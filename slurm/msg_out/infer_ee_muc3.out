( begin recording ) ( cristiani ) i do not believe there is any problem in the officers returning to the country if a judge orders that they come to testify. all that is required is for the judge to summon them ; they would be brought to the country to testify and, after that, returned to their training courses. groups of soldiers are frequently sent abroad to take training courses to make them more professional ; this applies not only to personnel from the military school, but from all armed forces units. concerning the other matter, the judge has to investigate it. i believe that instead of just staying there, the judge should continue to search for evidence. tell me, what is the difference if they are brought back from suchitoto or from the united states if they must testify before the judge? there is no difference at all.

ize's state radio on thursday reported that a guatemalan gunboat fired at a british naval vessel that has been conducting a survey in belize's waters. the radio said the incident occurred last sunday in the waters off southern belize. the report said that the hms fawn, which has been conducting holographic surveys, was reportedly in belizean territorial waters -- near the median line where the sea boundaries of honduras, belize and guatemala meet -- when `` a guatemalan gunboat ordered the ship to stop. '' the instruction was ignored, the radio said, `` whereupon the guatemalan vessel fired a shot in the direction of the british survey vessel. '' the british dispatched two royal airforce fighter planes to the `` general area and once the british harriers appeared at the site of the incident, the british communicated by telephone with guatemalan authorities, '' the radio reported. agreement was reached for the guatemalan vessel to withdraw from the area. british authorities have taken up the matter with guatemala and trust that guatemalan authorities will take measures to ensure `` that an unfortunate and dangerous incident '' which occurred on sunday `` will not recur, '' the radio said. in early october the guatemalan naval patrol in the same general area in the south of belize, seized a honduras registered boat along with its honduran crew and five belizeans including five fishermen and a marine biologist who were conducting deep sea fishing

 that the armed forces are involved in the murder of certain salvadoran citizens? ( duarte ) i understand that amnesty international has to prepare a report every year, and the organization includes whatever views it chooses in the report. the organization obviously states its views in the report. salvadorans do things according to the law. if any salvadoran or foreigner has evidence ( of human rights violations ), then it should be brought before the courts. that is the logical and legal way for us to begin an investigation ; that is what we always do in all such cases. ( reporter ) mr president, your government has issued a special report claiming that some death squad members have deserted and implicated several right-wing members in the murder of msgr oscar arnulfo romero and other salvadorans. ( duarte ) we are analyzing the available evidence in those cases. you know that i have carefully analyzed the cases. i released information only when the evidence was duly investigated and corroborated. we are processing a sizable amount of information, but i do not want to discuss it in detail because i believe that this would hinder the investigation. ( reporter ) is it true that you have two video recordings in which the two deserters give their names and details and that these recordings are being analyzed by military intelligence services and the government? ( duarte ) we are currently investigating the case. that is why i said that i would not like to reveal any detailed information -- because this might hinder the investigation

 gomez, who have been driven mad by barbarism, and that is why it grieves me to see the seriousness of the current salvadoran conflict and crisis. i, however, believe the democratic process will be strengthened. i believe the minds of men will be transformed positively, and ideological struggles -- even the most polarized ones -- will be definitely solved by the civilized means of the electoral process. i call on all political parties to strengthen the current political process and put the sacred interests of the nation before any other interests because that is the only way to protect the republic and consolidate the democratic revolution that belongs to all salvadorans. i also want to make a call to all groups so the electoral process, which will culminate with the election of a new president next year, develops with the spiritual grandeur that corresponds to courageous people, who wish to show the world their political maturity and their desire to live in peace. the electoral process will slowly consolidate. i believe sooner than later, good judgement will prevail in the minds of those who have been driven mad by barbarism."}

 the no vote victory, which is expected to be sustained, is expected to be defused by the government's political objectives, which are now much more dependent than before on the government's political objectives. one option is to keep on doing `` more of the same, '' to ignore the new context that has developed since 5 october, to defuse the monetary time bomb and to apply a tight tourniquet to the economy to prevent renewed outbreaks of higher prices. the inflation `` bogeyman '' is beginning to make his presence felt ( the consumer price index, cpi, is expected to be up 1.3 to 1.5 percent this month ), and explanations abound. gerardo aceituno, the head of the forecasting workshop of the labor economy program, attributes the mounting inflationary pressures to the impact of the wage hike and higher international interest rates on domestic prices. he recalls that the prices of farm products have been `` virtually frozen for a year '' and that this explains the huge gap between the wholesale price index, which fell one percent during the past 12 months, and the cpi, which rose 12 percent during the same period. `` the situation could not be sustained, except if businessmen wanted to sacrifice their profit margins, which have so far not been affected, because the vat was cut.
