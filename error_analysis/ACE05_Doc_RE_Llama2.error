===========Input: New Questions About Attacking Iraq; Is Torturing Terrorists Necessary? BEGALA : Well, we'll debate that later on in the show. We'll have a couple ofexperts come out, so I'll withhold my comments until then. Even as thesecretary of homeland security was putting his people on high alert lastmonth, a 30-foot Cuban patrol boat with four heavily armed men landed onAmerican shores, utterly undetected by the Coast Guard Secretary Ridgenow leads. Now, why has our president placed homeland security in thehands of Republican political hacks instead of professionals, by the way?Attorney General John Ashcroft, for example, is a career politician. Helost an election to a dead man. Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridgeis another career politician who was passed over by Mr. Bush for the vicepresidency. And Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Asa Hutchinson isyet another career politician and a graduate of the disgraceful Bob JonesUniversity. Apparently, Mr. Bush only turns to professionals when it'sreally important, like political consulting. NOVAK : Paul, as I understand your definition of a political -- of a professionalpolitician based on that is somebody who is elected to public office. Nowin your administration, the Clinton administration, there were thesemembers of the cabinet who by your definition were professionalpoliticians -- Lloyd Bentsen, Les Aspin, William S. Cohen, Janet Reno,Bruce Babbitt, Mike Espy, Dan Glickman, Norman Mineta, Henry Cisneros,Federico Pena, Bill Richardson, Richard Riley, 12 of them, not to mentionformer Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, and one of the greatprofessional politicians of all time, Bill Daly. BEGALA : And you know what, they did a hell of a job for our country. And thesebozos let four armed Cubans land on our shores when they're trying tomake a high terrorist alert. Our president has put homeland security inthe hands of failed Republican hacks. Hire professionals, Mr. President. NOVAK : So it's OK -- it's OK to have professional politicians at the JusticeDepartment and the Pentagon... BEGALA : Janet Reno was a career prosecutor. NOVAK : Just a minute, let me finish my sentence, please. It's OK to putDemocratic career politicians at the Pentagon and the Justice Departmentif they're Democrats but not if they're Republicans, is that right? BEGALA : No, the difference is Janet Reno was a career prosecutor. BEGALA : John Ashcroft wasn't half the woman that Janet Reno was. NOVAK : Another potential Democratic presidential candidate pondered whether torun, and he made his announcement, and surprise, surprise, the answer wasno. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut made the announcement todaythat he would not be the 10th candidate for the nomination. Why not?Surely Chris Dodd is at least more credible than Carol Moseley-Braun orDennis Kucinich. He explained he could better spend the next two years onhomeland security, the economy and judicial nominations. I guess thatmeans harassing Tom Ridge, fighting tax cuts and obstructing PresidentBush's plans to reform judiciary. Some two years. BEGALA : God, I hope so. that's all I can say. I love Senator Dodd. He would havebrought a lot to the race. He brings a lot to the Senate and to thedebate. And I'm glad that he's going to be fighting those fights. Well,the Commerce Department reports today that consumer spending declined inJanuary and that the manufacturing sector slowed in February. In all, twomillion Americans have lost their jobs under President Bush so far, notto mention three of them being the top three leaders of his economicteam. Meanwhile, the deficit now at $300 billion. It could swell to asmuch as $500 billion if we go to war in Iraq. Mr. Bush apparently isuntroubled by this fiscal collapse. One of his aides tells the currentissue of "TIME," magazine, quote, "even if it's $500 billion, so what?"Of course, even a $500 billion deficit number doesn't count the $3trillion Mr. Bush is robbing from the Social Security trust fund. Youknow, we should have known, every time George W. Bush gets in trouble, heborrows from a trust fund. It's been his whole life, you know. NOVAK : Let me give you two economic facts of like, which you should know, evenif you won't recognize them. Number one, there is absolutely norelationship between the deficit and unemployment. They don't gotogether. And number two, there is no Social Security fund, Virginia.There just isn't one. BEGALA : Because Bush squandered it on his tax cuts. NOVAK : There never has been one. BEGALA : There has been one for 60 years.

===========Input: New Questions About Attacking Iraq; Is Torturing Terrorists Necessary? NOVAK : Welcome back. Orders went out today to deploy 17,000 U.S. Army soldiersin the Persian Gulf region. The army's entire first Calvary divisionbased at Fort Hood, Texas, would join the quarter million U.S. forcesalready in the region. We're talking about possibilities of full scalewar with former Congressman Tom Andrews, Democrat of Maine. He's nownational director of Win Without War, and former Congressman Bob Dornan,Republican of California. BEGALA : Bob, one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about thiswar and so many people around the world don't want to go is there havebeen a lot of problems with credibility from this administration. Ourpresident has repeatedly, for example, relied on a man whom you're aware,Hussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, leader of the Iraq armsprogram who defected for a time. And gave us a whole lot of informationand then went home and his father-in-law killed him. Bad move. But whilehe was here, he gave us a whole lot of information. Gave us a whole lotof information. Well, our president told us that information proves thatthe dictator had chemical weapons, which is true. But what we justlearned this week from "Newsweek" magazine which got a hold of thedebriefings, is that he also told us it was destroyed back in 1995. Whyhasn't our president told us that? Why do we have to learn it from"Newsweek"? DORNAN : I don't believe that he believed it was all destroyed. The fact that thisguy was such an idiot to go back and let his father-in-law kill him showshe wasn't the most stable of people. But the things that... BEGALA : Good point. But shouldn't our president have told us what the CIA toldhim. Why do we learn from "Newsweek?"Should he level with us? DORNAN : Paul, look, the problem is I would stipulate all four of us hates war.Any rational person hates war. Bush isn't sitting in that White House notthinking about the body bags coming home with great young men. Clintonsuffered greatly over the 19 Rangers that died, 18 on the 3rd of Octoberand Matt Reersen (ph) three days later. I visited all their families. Iwas at the medal of honor ceremony for the kids. Let me tell you, whattrips to Walter Reed taught me was, that whoever thought up the term, thelaw of unintended consequences it pertains to war. I am shook over theaftermath. But, this guy is a monster, a mini-me Hitler. He will blow acity off the earth in a minute if he can get the hold of the means to doit. NOVAK : Tom Andrews, I think we all realize that a government doesn't go to war anation goes to war. And so I would like you to take a look at theCNN/"USA TODAY"/Gallup poll, taken last week, should U.S. troops to go toIraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Take a look at it. Favor 59%,opposed 37%, that's a vastly larger support than President Bush Seniorhad in getting the U.S. troops out of Kuwait before that war started.That's pretty good support isn't it? ANDREWS : Now, Bob, come on you don't really buy this. I mean, listen, this is theoldest trick in the book. You can have a general question like this thatcould mean anything and ask people and they give you what comes off thetop of their head. But, ask them another question, ask them what theythink about spending $1.3 trillion in destroying this economy. Ask themabout going and not just a war, Bob, but an invasion and occupying for upto 10 years a sovereign Arab nation in the midst of one of the mostdistable and volatile regions in the world. Ask them how they feel aboutgetting bogged down. Well, I've seen some of the figures. Once you starttelling Americans the story, -- the administration refuse today tell usstory. They're not coming forward and telling us what the risks are, whatthe costs are, how many years we might be in, the possibility of usgetting bogged down, because what Americans know that, they're opposed tothis war. The more they learn about this invasion, the more they learnabout this occupation, the less they support it. DORNAN : Tom, you know what liberals want. They don't want a smoking gun, theywant a smoking city. The Clinton people all say... BEGALA : That's going to have to be last war, unfair and unfortunate as that is, Iam sorry, they're telling us we're out of time. Former Congressman, BobDornan from California... DORNAN : You're not going to get a smoking city.

===========Input: New Questions About Attacking Iraq; Is Torturing Terrorists Necessary? NOVAK : Former Arkansas Governor and U.S. Senator Dale Bumpers has just publisheda memoir called "The Best Lawyer in a One-Lawyer Town." And it spans hislife from the depression era to the Clinton era. Let's ask him which wasmore depressing. BEGALA : First, thank you for writing this book. It is extraordinary. It iswonderful. And then we read you one passage. You cite a session you hadwith President Lyndon Johnson in Austin, I guess, at his ranch, right?Here is what you quote our President Johnson to you. "When I was majorityleader, and later president, I spent all my time pulling every powerstring I could find to pull, trying to pass bills that helped people.That made their lives better and the country stronger. That's what theDemocrats stand for." "Republicans? Republicans just stand for twothings: protecting the rich and investigation Democrats." That's true,though, isn't it? Johnson was right, wasn't he? BUMPER : I thought that was one of the most prescient things I ever heard, andthat was long before White Water. BEGALA : Yes. He never heard of Ken Starr, but he anticipated it. BUMPERS : Nothing ever changes, Paul. NOVAK : Can I interrupt this Democratic picnic for just a minute? You know,Senator, inadvertently, you gave support in this book to one of my petpolitical themes, which you probably don't agree with. On page 256 yousay, "As the years went by" -- this is when you were in the Senate --"less and less information was new, fewer and fewer arguments were fresh,and the repetitiveness of the old arguments became tiresome." "I wasbecoming almost as cynical as my constituents. I knew it was time toleave." Isn't that a great argument for term limits? I know very fewsenators or any who are as good in their third term as they are in theirfirst term. Shouldn't we limit them to two terms? BUMPERS : First of all, that statement is not designed to cover everybody in theUnited States Senate. But I must say, that's a pretty accurate statement.But it has nothing do with term limits, in my opinion. I think termlimits is the worst idea I ever heard of. BEGALA : Amen. NOVAK : I tried at least. BEGALA : Let me turn one more page, to page 257, actually, right next door towhere Bob was reading. This struck me because you've got the courage tosay something that is heretical today and it's music to my ears. You say,"Partisanship has taken on an odious connotation, and it may indeed beshriller now than ever. But we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that wehave two political parties so people will have choices. If everybodyagreed on everything, it might be a tranquil society, but it surely wouldbe a dole one, and certainly not certainly a good one." BUMPERS : You know, Paul, that's the reason we have two parties, so people have achoice. And I've said many times, if we all agreed on everything,everybody would want to marry Betty and we would really be in a mess,wouldn't we, Bob? NOVAK : Senator Bumpers, of the 22 senators of the old confederacy, when I got toWashington with the Associated Press, 45 years ago, 22 of them wereDemocrats, nine were Republicans. Now 13 are Republicans and nine areDemocrats. And of the Democrats, I don't think there is a real liberal.Your last year in the Senate I had an interview with you and I wrote acolumn called "The Last Southern Liberal." BUMPERS : And I thank you. It was a very flattering article, Bob. NOVAK : And you said, I'll quote it, you said, today's Southern voters are"children of Democrats who are not swayed by the same things theirmothers and fathers were. They certainly are susceptible to theRepublican message." That's a good future for the Democratic Party in theSouth. BUMPERS : Bob, I think that the reason everybody in the south -- you know, first ofall, we were -- when Franklin Roosevelt was elected president, we hadbeen living what we thought was still a conquered nation after the CivilWar. And we felt that Franklin Roosevelt was the first person who everreally acknowledged that the South had peculiar problems. And from thattime on, that's the reason we had 22 Democratic senators from 11confederate states, is because of the Civil War and because of what wethought was a heavy hand of the federal government all the time. Ofcourse there was always that old story about the Yankees, and Yankeeswere synonymous with Republicans. But that's all changed and memorieshave dimmed. And people, you know, they don't remember that. And so themessage, the Republicans have actually had a golden opportunity to maketheir case and they've done it successfully. And the Democrats needdesperately to get a message to counter that, and they need to get amessage and stay on it. I mean we cannot be all over the lot. NOVAK : (UNINTELLIGIBLE) they're just not buying the new deal anymore in theSouth. Isn't that the truth? BUMPERS : Well, that's true. They're not buying a new deal. But I'll tell you themessage the Democrats ought to be -- that every time we get sort ofwithin the grasp of the golden age, I mean within reach of the goldenage, where everybody has health care, where everybody gets a goodeducation -- you know I'm one of the million and a half people -- mybrother went to Harvard, I went to Northwestern University. Two schoolsmy father couldn't have even thought about affording. A million and ahalf veterans came out of War World II on the GI bill and got that kindof an education. If that makes me a liberal, because I believe thegovernment has a role to play in that, then I am a certified liberal,because I think that made the country stronger. I think certainly it madeevery one of those people stronger, and I think we ought to be doing itright now. No child in this country ought to be deprived of an educationfor lack of money. No elderly person ought to have to make a choicebetween food and medicine. And they do it by the millions every day. Andnow... BEGALA : Will you run for president? I'll chair a committee. Dale Bumpers forpresident, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. BUMPERS : Thank you, Paul. BEGALA : That was just terrific. The book again is Dale Bumpers, "The Best Lawyerin a One-Lawyer Town." I highly recommend it. And next in our "Fireback"segment, one of our viewers has a question about our president's conceptof democracy. Stay tuned.

===========Input: New Questions About Attacking Iraq; Is Torturing Terrorists Necessary? NOVAK : Time for "Fireback," when the viewers fire back at us. Joshua Hosford ofNewport Beach, California -- that would be nice in this weathers --"Paul, I guess we're going after all. Case in point, Khalid ShaikhMohammed. It's amazing how someone can actually do two things at once.I'm chewing gum and talking on the phone while writing this note."Joshua, you couldn't have said anything better. In fact, I've alreadysaid it. BEGALA : Well, in fact, our allies got Mr. Mohammed along with us. We need allies.And Bush is so far angered every ally we have. Dan Snyder of Baden,Pennsylvania writes, "Bush should torture the al Qaeda chief operationsofficer. Bush has been torturing Americans for two years. Why should thisguy get preferential treatment?" NOVAK : And I thought he was -- I thought he was busy running the Redskins. No?OK. The next comment is from Frank Mastro of New York City. "Mr. Novak, Idon't understand the problem. If the budget goes through as is, why don'tMr. Begala and Mr. Carville just donate the extra tax money they don'twant?" I say that to all the rich millionaire Democrats, like Carvilleand Begala, who don't want tax cuts. Pay it anyway. BEGALA : I'll donate to the Democrats. They'll defeat Bush and everybody will getrich. That's a better strategy. David Horn of Long Island, New York,writes, "How can Bush say he's for democracy? He had to sue to become ourpresident, and he keeps trying to bribe other countries' democraticgovernments into his supporting his agenda. Where did he learn to govern,1930's Chicago?"

I had a question also aboutKhalid Shaikh Mohammed. And now how are people going to argue that theU.S. can no longer both fight a war with Iraq and also fight terrorism,specifically al Qaeda? NOVAK : That's a great question. It's an unanswerable point. He hasn't been ableto answer it. And Tom Andrews (ph) wasn't able to answer it. BEGALA : Look, we need allies to catch these guys. We got him because thePakistanis got him. We didn't get him. We go to war in Iraq, 200,000people start protesting in Pakistan, they put too much pressure on thegovernment. It becomes impossible for those governments to cooperate withus like they're cooperating now. We go to war in Iraq, it would be theworst thing we can do... NOVAK : You know the one thing the Democrats can't stand is good news. It is justsomething you cannot handle. BEGALA : No. What I can't stand is a president who is going to screw up our waragainst terrorism when I thought that was his job. From the left, I'mPaul Begala. Good night for CROSSFIRE.

===========Input: Interview With Ralph Nader, Donald Palmisano; Interview With 
Congressmen J.D. Hayworth, Bernie Sanders BEGALA : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE. President Bush today renewed his call for a$250,000 cap on pain and suffering damages from the victims of medicalmalpractice. Ironically down in North Carolina today was also the dayfuneral services were held for 17-year-old Jesica Santillan, the braveyoung woman who got the wrong heart and lungs in a botched transplantoperation last month. Is her family's pain and suffering only worth$250,000? Here to debate medical malpractice reform are consumer advocateRalph Nader and Dr. Donald Palmisano, the president-elect of the AmericanMedical Association. NOVAK : Ralph Nader, there are states in crisis that keep adding to the list bythe AMA where doctors are going out of business because they can't affordthe medical malpractice rates. We'll just run a scroll of some of thestates. They're big states. Florida, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,Pennsylvania, Illinois, Texas. This is a real crisis that lawyers haveperpetrated on America, isn't it? RALPH NADER, CONSUMER ADVOCATE : Another one of your leading questions. This is a medical malpracticecrisis. Over 80,000 Americans, 220 every day die from medical negligence,hundred of thousands are injured. And the insurance companies which hadrelatively steady rates on doctors for about 10 years have found itsinvestment income, its interest income, the stock market collapse down.And so they're jacking up the rates on a few key specialties likeobstetricians and neurosurgeons. But if you take the entire amount ofpremiums, Bob, that's paid by doctors in this country to malpracticeinsurers and divide it evenly, they'd be paying less than $9,000 each.That's one-third of what they pay a receptionist. NOVAK : That runs against the fact that so many of them are just leaving theirpractice because they can't afford it. You know, Ralph, you and I oftenagree on some things and one thing I think we agree on is the dirtyeffect of money and politics. Can you say that the lawyers, the triallawyers who appoint millions and millions of dollars into Democraticcoffers in order to keep this, do you believe that this is healthy... NADER : Well, as much as they've poured into those coffers, it's much less thanwhat the doctors, the malpractice insurers, the hospital chains and theHMOs and the nursing home chains have poured into members of Congress'coffers. This is first and foremost, Bob, a question of equity. Are wegoing to allow severely injured people who have found a lung taken outthat's the wrong lung or a double mastectomy that wasn't indicated thatwas inflicted on a woman in the Midwest, or that organ transplant thatwas incompatible on that 17-year-old teenager in North Carolina. Are wegoing to say to these and so many others, you can't have your full day incourt? The Congress is going to handcuff the judges and juries in theUnited States at the state court level? I haven't yet met one senator orrepresentative who's for this bill who has demonstrated that the jurorsin their home state and the judges in their home state are incompetent,unwilling or unable to perform justice in these medical malpracticecases. And I've never heard one person say that the insurance executiveswho make $250,000 a week, every week without any pain and suffering, noone is saying cap those. BEGALA : Dr. Palmisano, first thank you for being here. DR. DONALD PALMISANO, PRESIDENT-ELECT, AMA : Thank you. Pleasure to be here. BEGALA : There was a hear on Capitol Hill today. And, I want to ask you to respondto one of the witnesses, John McCormick testified today. He's the fatherof a little girl, 13-month-old girl, who he said today died because ofmedical malpractice. He said that the hospital ignored abnormal CO2levels in her blood. Said that the attending physician had slept throughseveral pages. She died awaiting surgery. Listen to what Mr. McCormicksaid and I'll ask you to respond. JOHN MCCORMICK, FATHER OF MALPRACTICE VICTIM : Mr. President, from father to father, my family's pain and suffering arenot frivolous. BEGALA : Isn't he right? Isn't our president wrong to be -- did he win theLottery? You know, Mr. Bush -- President Bush says these guys have wonthe litigation Lottery. Does that look like a Lottery winner to you,holding a picture of his dead baby? PALMISANO : Well, the current medical liability system is affecting patients in thatthey can't get access to care. The American Medical Association worksvery hard to make safety a priority in the medical care system. That'swhy we founded the National Patient Safety Foundation. The current systemdoesn't measure negligence. It measures disability. And what we'refinding now is that the emergency rooms are closing, trauma centers areclosing, pregnant women can't find a doctor to deliver the baby, a boyknocked unconscious has to be transported to another state. Anotherwitness today told of what happened to her husband because there were nolonger neurosurgeons available in the community. The patient had to beairavacked and by that time it was too late to prevent the brain damage. BEGALA : Those are important points, I don't doubt. PALMISANO : Yes. BEGALA : But I wonder if you can respond to Mr. McCormick's point. Who are you,who's our president to tell him that his suffering is only worth $250,000for the loss of a child? PALMISANO : Well, what has to be done here is balance. What we need is a systemthat's fair to everyone, a system that keeps the physicians in practiceand allows patients to have access to physicians in their hour of need.And the system in California that's in the bill, in Congress now, HR-5,that's a system that has worked. It brought stability to California andobstetricians in California will pay 55, 57, $60,000 in Los Angeles andin South Florida in Miami, they'll pay $210,000...(CROSSTALK) NADER : Because in California they have regulated the insurance company premiumlevels. And in Florida, they've been very weak on it. And in some states,for example, there are doctors that are -- you know, there are 45 payoutsin ten years and they're not disciplined by the state medical board. Imean, you've got 5 percent of the doctors accounting for over 55 percentof the payoffs, Paul. In other words a small percentage of doctors thatare bad, incompetent, indifferent, whatever. They're not performingproperly and the AMA is not cracking down, is not supporting expansion tostate licensing... PALMISANO : I want to respond to that. The National Practitioner Data Bank is thesource of the information and it was brought up today. First of all, theGovernment Accounting Office criticized the methodology used. It listsmultiple claims against one physician when actually it's really oneclaim, different insurers pay on the same physician and it's counted asone claim. It doesn't mention whether they are obstetricians,neurosurgeons or emergency medicine. It doesn't list that. Right now inSouth Florida, in South Florida, the latest poll shows that everyneurosurgeon has been sued. The average number of suits against aneurosurgeon is five in South Florida. Now are these bad doctors? We'llhave no doctors, we'll have no neurosurgeons, no obstetricians... NOVAK : We've got to take a break. NADER : Maybe they are bad doctors.

===========Input: Interview With Ralph Nader, Donald Palmisano; Interview With 
Congressmen J.D. Hayworth, Bernie Sanders NOVAK : Welcome back. Both the AMA and the Bush administration released reportsthis week saying out of control trial lawyers are driving doctors out oftheir practices all across the country. President Bush points this waytoday, even the most frivolous of lawsuits cost money, premiums go up andeither way, the patient pays. We're debating malpractice reform withconsumer advocate Ralph Nader, and AMA President-Elect Dr. RonaldPalmisano. BEGALA : Dr. Palmisano, again, thanks for staying with us through the break. Letme set aside the hypocrisy of a man who became president because of alawsuit trying to eliminate everybody else's lawsuits, but instead focuson his own experience. He was the governor of my state of Texas, wherethere are a whole lot of doctors. It turns out that he didn't do any kindof a job policing your profession at all when he was the governor ofTexas. Here's what the "Dallas Morning News" reported recently: "TheTexas State Board of Medical Examiners, the agency that pledges toprotect the public has granted second and third chances to surgeons whoare thrown out of hospitals because they botched operations. It hasforgiven physicians who overlook cancerous tumors, who maimed infants orwhose mistakes left women sterilized. It has refused in the last fiveyears to revoke the license of a single doctor for committing medicalerrors. Thousands more may have been ignored over the last decade." Thatis the Bush record in policing surgeons, why should we trust him now? PALMISANO : Well, first off... BEGALA : Physicians generally, not just surgeons, forgive me. PALMISANO : Sure. What we need to do is to make sure that state boards, number one,have adequate funding. The AMA supports that. If there are any baddoctors we want them removed from the practice of medicine. But it'salso... BEGALA : ... bad doctors? PALMISANO : Well, it's also unfair to make a judgment without knowing all of thefacts of the case. Because someone pays money in a case, the insurancecompany may pay money because they're afraid there's is going to be agiant award in this case because of this broken liability system. TroyBrennan (ph) of Harvard said there's no correlation with negligence, onlywith disability. So let's look at all of the facts, but give everybodydue process here in America before we criticize. NADER : Actually, Troy Brennan, the same doctor at Harvard Public School ofHealth said the issue is not to fuel lawsuits, it's too many. Less than10 percent of the victims of medical malpractice, and we're talking abouthorrific injuries here, even file a claim. Even file a claim. And theentire pay-out to all of the victims that get a little money, not the 90percent who never file a claim, amounts to less than what we spend on dogfood. On dog food. It's about $5.4 billion is the pay-out. That's afraction of physician income. It's a fraction of the health care expenseof 1.4 trillion. PALMISANO : What we have to do is look at all the facts and have balance here. That'swhat the people in Congress have to do. They have to make sure thatwhatever they decide keeps doctors in practice and patients having accessto care. NADER : Doctors are going... PALMISANO : But let me - but let me - wait... NADER : Doctors are leaving practice because of insurance premium, right? Is thatright? They don't abandon their patients, except for the high premiums ofa few specialties? PALMISANO : Because of the premiums. But first of all let me... NADER : Why don't you crack down on the insurance companies? PALMISANO : No. Let's talk about the facts. Let's talk about the facts. NADER : That's the fact. PALMISANO : (UNINTELLIGIBLE) percent of the doctors are insured by physician-ownedinsurance companies, the medical side. I was just in Oklahoma, they ownthis insurance company. They are trying to do their very best. It's acompany not for profit. What happens here is that more money is beingpaid out than comes in. And as far as the investment income, A.M. Bests(ph) show that in the past five years, the investment income has beenstable at around 5 percent. Brown Brothers Harriman said that investmentsdid not precipitate the current crisis. NADER : ... payoffs have been stable, adjusted for inflation, NationalPractitioners Databank (ph). Why do you want that to be secret? All ofthe information about bad doctors in the National Practitioner bank, you,the AMA wants to keep it secret from other doctors and other patientsaround the country who want to know whether their doctor is on that list. NOVAK : Well, let's look at what the president is actually proposing for peoplewho have been harmed by a bad doctor. Let's listen to what he said to theAMA today. BUSH : If harmed by a doc, they ought to be able to recover their economiccosts, economic losses. They should be able to recover non- economicdamages as well. But for the sake of the system, non- economic damagesshould be capped at $250,000. NOVAK : What in the world is wrong with that? Tell me what's wrong with that? NADER : What's wrong? Tell someone who had a double mastectomy, tell an infantwho's brain-damaged and has no economic loss that for the rest of theirlives they're going to get dribbled out $250,000 for their entire lifeexpectancy? Wait a minute. The head of AIG a few years ago was making$250,000 every week. NOVAK : Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money, though. Not foryou, but for most people it's a lot of money. NADER : These executives, why don't you tell... PALMISANO : In California - wait, Mr. Nader. In California... NADER : Why don't you cap insurance... BEGALA : Mr. Palmisano, go ahead. PALMISANO : Give me a moment, please. NADER : Go ahead, go ahead. PALMISANO : In California where they have this law, it caps the non-economics, theones you can't quantify. There are awards in 10 million, 20 million, $30million in California for economic. So all medicals, all rehabilitation,care services in the home, lost wages... NOVAK : No, no, no. I've got to ask Mr. Nader, we are almost out of time. DougFriedman (ph), who ran Jesse Ventura's campaign for governor four yearsago, says he wants you to run for president again. I know you're sayingit's much too early to run for president. But one simple question, Ralph,will you consider another run for president? NADER : Much too early to consider. I am concerned about Donald Zook (ph), who'shead of a medical malpractice insurance company, a big one in the West,saying that his insurance company executive colleagues should not blamethe tort injury system. He said that your problem of jacking up theseinsurance rates is self-inflicted. Here's an insurance company executivewho is saying that. PALMISANO : Well, Mr. Zook is one executive you are quoting. What we need to do islook at all of the people who don't have doctors... NADER : Hey, let's get some agreement. Should we get some agreement? PALMISANO : What... NADER : Do you want to really crack down on the bad doctors? PALMISANO : We want to crack down on the attorneys who file frivolous suits. NADER : Fine. Fine. PALMISANO : Seventy percent of the cases filed are told there's no payment. What kindof peer review is that? NADER : Wait. Wait. Do you want to crack down on the bad doctors? You're in AMA. PALMISANO : We definitely want to crack down on bad doctors. But...(CROSSTALK) NADER : Do you want to control insurance rates? PALMISANO : We want the free market to dictate what is done. BEGALA : The free market actually dictates we have got to sell some commercialshere on CNN or we're all out of... PALMISANO : Thanks. Privilege to be here.

===========Input: Interview With Ralph Nader, Donald Palmisano; Interview With 
Congressmen J.D. Hayworth, Bernie Sanders BEGALA : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE. Over in Iraq, arms inspectors are discoveringand destroying missiles. Spy planes are searching for more banned arms,and Iraqi scientists are being interviewed by U.N. weapons inspectors.But here in Washington, President Bush says it's all a hoax, and manybelieve he has already made up his mind to go to war. Back with us totalk about it, two Congressmen: J.D. Hayworth, the Republican fromArizona, and Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont. NOVAK : Congressman Sanders, you're opposed to this war. I'm not crazy about itmyself. But I want to ask you a question. When the guns begin to fire,when the American men and women are in harm's way and may be dying, isthat now the time for you and your allies to shut up and support thetroops? SANDERS : Well it's not -- are you suggesting that when tens and thousands of Iraqiwomen and children are killed, and when young men and women in thiscountry are unnecessarily put at harm's risk, what should we do? Theanswer is, these are my neighbors from Vermont and obviously we're goingto support them. And obviously we're going to pray that there's fewercasualties... NOVAK : Are you going to demonstrate against them in the streets? SANDERS : No, I don't demonstrate against anybody during a war. But let's be clear.The president almost unilaterally is putting us in this position againstworld opinion. NOVAK : Didn't the Congress support it? I thought you voted for it. SANDERS : I did not vote for it. NOVAK : I mean the Congress. The majority rules. SANDERS : Yes. The Congress gave him authority, but the American people disagreedwith the decision. NOVAK : Not according to the polls. SANDERS : Not the polls that I have seen. BEGALA : Congressman Hayworth, back to a comment. And I know that you meant it andI agreed with it. You said, "This is Saddam Hussein, the butcher ofBaghdad." I'm curious, would that have accurately described him in 1988? HAYWORTH : Oh, yes. I think it does. I think it has described him, especially sincehe's taken basically a one-man rule over with the Baath Party in 1979. BEGALA : I agree. Therefore, wasn't Dick Cheney, as the CEO of Halliburton, wrongto be selling oilfield equipment to the butcher of Baghdad in 1988? HAYWORTH : I don't know about any oil equipment going to Saddam Hussein. What I doknow in the here and now is... BEGALA : I can tell you about it if you like. HAYWORTH : That's fine. And I know you'd love to cloud the issue. BEGALA : That's an important issue to me. HAYWORTH : No, it's so important -- you know this -- and I know it's fun and we lovedoing partisan Punch &amp; Judy, but is there ever a time when we stand upeven if we respectfully disagree with the commander in chief and thosewho would wage war? Dissent is fine, but these cheap shots, I don't knowanything about Halliburton. BEGALA : He had $73 million worth of (UNINTELLIGIBLE) to sell oilfield equipmentto Saddam Hussein. HAYWORTH : What I do know is Saddam Hussein has butchered over a million of his owncitizens. And to somehow try to play partisan parlor games may be cute,but we are dealing with a clear and present danger. BEGALA : Would you have treated him as a customer, the way Dick Cheney did? HAYWORTH : I don't even know about that. BEGALA : Would you have sold oilfield equipment to him? SANDERS : Furthermore, the United States supported him in the war against Iran. HAYWORTH : Yes. Hello? Iran had hostages. Seventy-nine Americans were held hostage. SANDERS : Hello? Hello? We're talking... SANDERS : What we're talking about is the unpredictable nature of war and whatcould happen in this war. For example -- wait a second -- in Iran, thereason that you had Ayatollah Khomeini in power is he overthrew the Shah.You who put the Shah in power? The United States of America. HAYWORTH : Oh the evil United States. SANDERS : But the point is... NOVAK : I want to get to that point. But the problem with Khomeini was that theguy who he overthrew was put in power by the United States. I can't quitefigure that out. SANDERS : We overthrew (UNINTELLIGIBLE) and put the Shah of Iran in power.Everybody knows that. The CIA did that. NOVAK : But I mean you're attacking the CIA for putting him in, when it was --the problem was Khomeini. SANDERS : No, the point I made, Khomeini came about because we put a brutaldictator, the Shah of Iran, in power. The point that I am making is youcannot... HAYWORTH : The point you're making is blame America first. SANDERS : No I'm not. HAYWORTH : That's what you're doing. SANDERS : You're talking about blowback. You don't know what happens when the mostpowerful nation on Earth invades and occupies a Muslim nation and killstens of thousands of people. HAYWORTH : We know what happens. BEGALA : Congressman Sanders (UNINTELLIGIBLE). Bernie Sanders, an Independent fromVermont, thank you very much. Congressman J.D. Hayworth, a Republicanfrom Arizona, thank you both very much. We will come back to this debate,believe me. One of our viewers, though, thinks there's a sure fire way toget that al Qaeda ring leader to talk. We'll let him fire back in alittle bit. But next, out of all of the pictures from this weekend's nailbiter between J.D. Hayworth's alma mater of (UNINTELLIGIBLE) state, andBob Novak's beloved University of Maryland, only one photo is dramaticenough or politically charged enough to be the CROSSFIRE "Picture of theDay." You do not want to miss this.

And I'm curious, howcan Democrats claim that President Bush is ignoring the war on terror ifal Qaeda's second key operative was just caught? NOVAK : And it also proves you can even chew gum and walk at the same time.Doesn't it show that? BEGALA : He cannot eat a pretzel and watch a football became at the same time. SoI'm still doubtful of -- no, here's why. This is a serious point and youdeserve a serious answer. The way we caught that guy was by coordinatingwith our allies. We now have a foreign policy in Iraq that is puttingenormous strain on those allies. The same weekend they arrested the guy,we had... NOVAK : We had no part in it. BEGALA : No, it was a joint effort by Pakistan. Why do we want to sever thatrelationship with this idiotic war in Iraq? NOVAK : We're not severing it -- question. BEN CHARLTON : Hi. I'm Ben Charlton (ph) from East Lansing, Michigan. I was -- if wewait for U.N. approval for action in Iraq, don't we sacrifice some of ournational sovereignty? NOVAK : Well, where are all of the conservative questions? We never haveconservatives in the audience. There's no question. I think even Paulwould agree with me. The question of whether we go to war or not isstrictly a national question. It's not a United Nations question. BEGALA : That is correct. The president has got all of the legal authorities heneeds. I just pray to god he doesn't use it. We need to go to the U.N.because we want to build coalitions so we have support around the worldand so that we don't have to carry the burden ourselves.

Come Around to Bush Administration's Way of Thinking? PAUL BEGALA, CNN CO-HOST : Hello, everybody. Welcome to CROSSFIRE. On this Ash Wednesday, the popeasks Catholics to fast for peace and he asks President Bush to work forpeace, while the White House sends out Colin Powell to make yet anothercase for war. We will debate all of that as well as "Vanity Fair"'slatest, stunning revelations about Michael Jackson. Believe it or not, wegot new news on Michael Jackson. Do you think he really looks like amummy? Certainly not a daddy. But first, our own little moonwalk acrossthe political landscape, the "CROSSFIRE Political Alert." The foreignministers of France, Germany and Russia today issued a joint declarationthat they will not allow a second American-backed resolution to pass theUnited Nations Security Council. President Bush wants the SecurityCouncil to explicitly authorize force against Iraq, and his presssecretary today remained optimistic that in the end, that's just whathe'll get. President Bush is said to be focusing on one fence-sittingSecurity Council member, the African nation of Guinea, because he said --quote -- "I used to have one of their pigs." So -- OK, I made that up. Hedidn't say that. TUCKER CARLSON, CNN CO-HOST : Well, I suspected that. You know... BEGALA : But they are a swing vote. Guinea is an important swing vote. CARLSON : As is Cameroon. France and Germany are pointing to inspection and saying,Look, they're working. We don't need war. They're not pointing out thatinspections are working only because there's the credible threat of war.Saddam wouldn't be destroying missiles unless he thought he was going tobe destroyed if he didn't. BEGALA : I think that's a good point. It doesn't mean we have to go to war. But Ithink President Bush should get credit for pushing to instructions andbacking them up with the threat of force. CARLSON : It means when you take the threat of force of the table, you're likely tostop disarming Saddam Hussein. BEGALA : Yes, I'm not saying take the threat of force. I'm saying we don't need touse force right now. CARLSON : Well, France and Germany would like to. Secretary of State Colin Powelltoday responded to Saddam Hussein's latest attempts to fool the world.Powell called Iraqi steps toward disarmament -- quote -- "too little, toolate" gestures, meant to split international resolve to force Baghdad togive up its weapons of mass destruction. U.S. intelligence said Powellindicates Iraq has hidden equipment to produce al-Samoud 2 missiles, evenas it destroys existing ones, missiles that until recently, it claimednot to have. Powell also revealed that Iraq is hiding chemical andbiological weapons in poor neighborhoods around Baghdad. In order tosecure peace, Powell concluded, the international community must confrontSaddam Hussein's refusal to disarm -- quote -- "here and now." So, thereyou have it. The essence of the American case for war against SaddamHussein. The only question left: who do you believe? Secretary of StateColin Powell or France? BEGALA : No, the question is... CARLSON : That is the question. BEGALA : Who do you believe: the Bush administration or your lying eyes? We arewatching them destroy weapons, as the president says, Oh, that's just ahoax. CARLSON : But Paul... BEGALA : They are disarming. CARLSON : No, no, no that's not what the president's saying. He's saying, the --it's a hoax to the extent that those are only a small number of theweapons there. Keep in mind, these are weapons that Saddam Hussein, untilrecently, said he didn't even have. He's a liar. BEGALA : Of course. CARLSON : And to trust Saddam Hussein in effort to disarm him -- foolish task,don't you think? BEGALA : Absolutely. Nobody trusts Saddam Hussein. The question is, Is he asufficient threat to America today to risk the lives of our young men andwomen. CARLSON : That's a separate question. That's a very separate question. BEGALA : I think he's not. I think the inspections can work. CARLSON : That's a different argument. We can take it up later.

Come Around to Bush Administration's Way of Thinking? BEGALA : Well, those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media shouldconsider this: MSNBC, an obscure cable channel, has fired Phil Donahue,the host of its highest-rated show. A memo from inside NBC, reported onthe Web site allyourtv.com, and today in "The Washington Post," shows NBCbig wigs feared that the liberal Mr. Donahue represented in the words ofthe NBC memo -- quote -- "a difficult public face for NBC at a time ofwar, while our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunitybecause he seems to delight in presenting guests who are anti-war,anti-Bush and skeptical of the administration's motives." So there it is,according to NBC. Phil Donahue was fired because he's a liberal. In fact,the only liberal with the solo cable talk show. NBC, of course, is adivision of the conglomerate GE, where they apparently only bring rightwing things to life. CARLSON : I actually like Phil Donahue. I've interviewed him a number of times. Hisarguments are really dumb. I don't know if you've listened to PhilDonahue. Delightful guy, but his arguments don't make a lot of sense andI think that is the problem with liberal talk show hosts -- you excluded,of course, and James. But the arguments, actually, don't hold up verywell. Have you noticed that? BEGALA : You know, you can argue back and forth, but you shouldn't fire someonebecause of their political views and that's what NBC has done and shameon the General Electric corporation. He had the highest-rated show on thenetwork. CARLSON : Which is saying what? BEGALA : I used to work there. They're good to me. They're very nice people andthey're very good to me... CARLSON : OK, OK, I'm not beat up on MSNBC. BEGALA : ...but they shouldn't fire a guy for his political views.

Come Around to Bush Administration's Way of Thinking? CARLSON : Former Illinois Senator Carol Moseley-Braun recently decided to run forpresident. Early reviews have not been good, so yesterday she announcedshe'll be making some changes. Not to her ideas, which are few. Not toher record, which is pretty embarrassing. Not even to her staff, whichis, of course, tiny. But to her name. From here on out, CarolMoseley-Braun as Carol Moseley Braun. Did you catch the difference? Inthe second version, there is no hyphen between her last names. MoseleyBraun expects that primary voters in Iowa and New Hampshire will reactenthusiastically to this radical, grammatical transformation. They'llhave to, because the latest CNN poll shows Moseley Braun far behind thecandidate she set out to discredit. That would be, of course, thehonorable Al Sharpton. Sharpton is not only by far the first choice ofblack voters nationally, he is tied with Senator John Edwards among allvoters and beating Governor Howard Dean, Representative Dennis Kucinichand Senator Bob Graham. Beating them. And Al Sharpton didn't even have tochange his name. BEGALA : How did he become honorable? CARLSON : Yes! BEGALA : You become honorable by winning an election of some sort or having a highpost, being an ambassador or a governor or some thing. CARLSON : By embodying the values of your party. BEGALA : Your values, not mine. CARLSON : He's the No. 1 pick, the most popular, among all candidates, among blackprimary voters. I mean, you can't dismiss him. He's a serious candidate. BEGALA : We haven't even begun the primaries. He's not a serious candidate. He'sright wing fantasy and it's never going to happen. CARLSON : Not right wing. Take Al Sharpton seriously, that's our message tonight.In a moment, we'll ask two members of Congress if they're convinced thatwar is the only way to make Saddam Hussein disarm. Later, the popepractices religion and a little anti-war politics on the side. Then, canyou spell prosthetic nose? Maureen Orth can, and she does in a new"Vanity Fair" profile of Michael Jackson. We'll talk to her. You won'twant to miss that. We'll be right back.

Come Around to Bush Administration's Way of Thinking? CARLSON : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE. France, Russia and Germany today restatedtheir opposition to any new U.N. Security Council that could threatenSaddam Hussein's grip on power. Secretary of State Colin Powell goes tothe U.N. tomorrow to do what he can. We're talking with potential war inIraq with Congressman Charlie Rangel, a New York Democrat and his fellowNew Yorker Republican Congressman Peter King. BEGALA : Mr. King, thanks for stying with us through the break. One of the reasonsthat we like having you on, and as well as Mr. Rangel, is that, you know,this is war, as we were saying in the last segment. You treat it with thegravity and the seriousness that it deserves. And you're a congressmanwho has put his constituents and his country ahead of his partisaninterests. So I wonder if you'll join Charlie Rangel, who put out a pressrelease today, decrying the Republican attempt to hijack a bill to helpour servicemen to use it to give special interest tax breaks tocorporations. Isn't that wrong in a time of war? KING : The important thing is that the bill pass for the military. If the otherstuff's in there, it's there. I mean to me, the main purpose should bethe military. I'm not going to disagree with Charlie's point. On theother hand, often when bills are passed, there are things attached tothem. So to me, the key thing is that we ought to be taking care of themilitary and that's what we should do. CARLSON : Congressman Rangel, a couple of months ago Senator Daschle on CBS said --made the charge that we are, quote, "we haven't made any real progress inthe war against al Qaeda." A lot of Democrats said similar things. Thisweekend Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the No. 2 member of al Qaeda and anothersignificant al Qaeda member were captured in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.Doesn't it turn out that Mr. Daschle and others didn't know what theywere talking about and maybe they shouldn't make charges like that inpublic when they don't know what they were talking about? You would agreewith that, wouldn't you? RANGEL : If they don't have the pencil that's keeping score, they ought to keeptheir mouth shut because as a former federal prosecutor, every drugdealer I busted was the most important drug dealer in the world. You justpass out numbers on whoever you arrest. Why was he No. 3? Why wasn't heNo. 4? CARLSON : Well, I don't know. Because he helped plan the attack on the World TradeCenter and the Pentagon? I think that puts you pretty high up in theorganization. RANGEL : Let me tell you, when you arrest somebody, you describe who you'rearresting. I haven't the slightest clue who this guy was. CARLSON : I haven't heard anybody suggest that he's not one of the central figuresin al Qaeda. Have you? RANGEL : Listen, we should be arresting a lot of people. But I think the mainthing that we have now is we should concentrate on Osama bin Laden, weshould concentrate on dismantling Saddam Hussein. We should do all ofthose things, but the most important thing is we should not have thearrogance to have a preemptive strike against a defenseless nationwithout the... CARLSON : A defenseless nation? They have biological weapons. How are theydefenseless? BEGALA : And how'd they get them? RANGEL : Listen, if this is... CARLSON : It was our fault that they have biological and chemical weapons? Come on. RANGEL : Let me tell you. They have it and we supported them having it when theywere fighting Iran so it's no big deal there. And the thing is that if wecan disarm them without actually going there, killing them, I reallythink that we maintain our moral authority around the world. We have alot of people... RANGEL : ... that have dangerous weapons. I mean, what happens if India decidesthat they could have a preemptive strike against Pakistan? What happensif the North Koreans take another look? Our country is great enough andstrong enough to maintain the moral authority to convince theinternational community that we're right. I don't think we have to killto prove that. BEGALA : I'm sorry to have to do this, but we are out of time. I want haveCongressman Peter King from New York back on, and Congressman CharlieRangel. Thank you both for a very interesting debate. One of the mostadmired men in the world is doing everything he can to avert the horrorof war. In a minute we will look at His Holiness, John Paul II's effortsto be a peacemaker. Later, the author of "Vanity Fair's" scary new lookat the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. You will not want to miss this. Staywith us.

Come Around to Bush Administration's Way of Thinking? BEGALA : Welcome back to CROSSFIRE. Maybe it's just me, but I think MichaelJackson, he's kooky, wacky. Time now for "Fireback," where our wacky andkooky fans and friends and critics right in. Don from Denver, Coloradowrites, "Paul, you keep referencing Halliburton selling equipment toIraq" -- which I do. "I recall, as reported in 'The Wall Street Journal,'that the transactions were legal. Is it possible that the equipmentallowed Iraq to produce oil for the Oil for Food program authorized bythe U.N.?" They were legal because Mr. Cheney's company used a loophole.They went through a foreign subsidiary. But they did enrich SaddamHussein and his evil, ruthless regime, and they were immoral. They werewrong. Dick Cheney should have never profited off of doing business withSaddam Hussein. CARLSON : I would agree with that. What does that have to do with the war in Iraq? BEGALA : It means Cheney is a hypocrite. He's trying to lead us into a war againstone of his valued customers. CARLSON : Well it's a complete... CARLSON : You're attacking the man. That's irrelevant to the argument. BEGALA : I'm attacking his business practices. CARLSON : No, no, you're attacking -- OK great. That's great. But it has nothing todo whether we should go to war with Iraq or not. BEGALA : Well yesterday he was a valued customer, today he's an even villain. CARLSON : Right. So we're against Dick Cheney, but that doesn't have anything to dowith Saddam Hussein. Chad Hensley, from Fairfax, Virginia, writes,"France, Russia and German have all multi-billion dollar oil deals withSaddam in Iraq. I wonder why they protest the war with Iraq. It must bethe humanitarian reasons." Well, Chad, that's what liberals assume. ThatEurope is against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds, but the U.S.is for the war because it wants to profit for the oil companies. It is aweird assumption, don't you think? BEGALA : As you know, I've never said that. CARLSON : You haven't. BEGALA : I don't believe for a minute that this is a war for oil. I think it'sunwise, it's unjust, it's unwarranted, but I don't think it's about oil.Now, the reason that France, Russia and Germany are against war isbecause they have democracies. The people are against it. It's calleddemocracy. Those leaders are reflecting the views of their people. CARLSON : They hate America, Paul.

Come Around to Bush Administration's Way of Thinking? CHRISTINA WRIGHT : My name is Christina Wright (ph). I'm from Minneapolis, Minnesota. And Iwas just curious if you feel that the attack on Iraq would actually opena Pandora's box in other Middle Eastern countries that we are known toaid and harbor terrorists, such as Syria and Iran. CARLSON : It might. I mean that's absolutely one of the fears. That it woulddestabilize the entire region. On the other hand, the region is prettyunstable, filled with people who already hate Americans and seek to doAmerica harm. So the question is, could it be worse? BEGALA : Our president believes it will set off a positive domino effect ofdemocracy through the region. Maybe he's right. I don't think he'sthought it through. I think it's more likely that this very unstableregion could cause even more problems. CARLSON : Oh, come on. That's silly. FABIAN : Hi. I'm Fabian from Bonn, Germany. And my question is, after today'smeeting in Paris, where France, Russia and Germany decided to not back asecond resolution, who is not (UNINTELLIGIBLE)? Is it the U.S. or is itold Europe? CARLSON : It's actually Western Europe, because 18 European countries are on theside of the United States. So France and Germany -- that's actually true-- find themselves in the minority on their own continent. And good. BEGALA : Only Great Britain is with us. The only country... CARLSON : What do you mean only Great Britain? BEGALA : My question is not who votes at the U.N. Who sends troops to die on ourside? Nobody except Great Britain. We are isolated.

===========Input: Iraq Blames Market Blast on Coalition WOODRUFF : We know that some of the American troops now fighting in Iraq arelongtime veterans of warfare, probably not most, but some. Their militaryservice goes back to the Vietnam era. Others, though, are novices. Sowhat is it like for them to face combat far from home? For an idea, hereis CNN's Candy Crowley with some war stories.  CANDY CROWLEY, CNN SR. POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : They are, we are told, well trained. SEN. CHUCK HAGEL (R), NEBRASKA : This is a messy business. There's nothing very pretty about the trainingthat you take to prepare you for combat, because it is to kill people. CROWLEY : In the spring of 1970, a squad of U.S. soldiers spotted a small unit ofViet Cong that had been circling for days. Staff Sergeant Tom Ridgeopened fire. A Viet Cong soldier dropped dead. (on camera): Did you atthe time or have you since looked back and pondered on killing someone? TOM RIDGE, HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY : Mm-hmm. CROWLEY : And what's that like? RIDGE : That's one of those introspective times where it's just -- it's just anintrospective time, not a public time. CROWLEY (voice-over) : Duke Cunningham was a Vietnam fighter ace shooting down five enemyplanes. After his first, he returned to a ship deck full of sailors andcrew cheering, shaking his hand, pushing in to slap his back. REP. RANDY CUNNINGHAM (R), CALIFORNIA : And one of the guys looked at me and says: Duke, what's it like to killsomebody? And, all of a sudden, bang, it just hit me. You don't thinkabout those things. And it's removed. It's far off. It's not in close.And I went to the priest, because it bothered me. I knew I could do itagain. But I didn't know it was going to bother me as much as it did. Andit still does. CROWLEY : Of all the wounds time does not heal, the ones that fester deep in thesoul are the wounds you inflict. RIDGE : It's not something that civilized people do. You don't -- it's just not-- it's not a matter of being tormented, but troubled in the sense thatthat's not what we do, unless we're called upon to do it, under the mostextreme set of circumstances. CROWLEY : War may sometimes be a necessary thing, but it can never be a naturalthing. Training bridges that gap. Sergeant Chuck Hagel was seriouslywounded twice in Vietnam. HAGEL : You are trying to kill people, because the alternative is, if you are incombat, you will be killed. So your choices are not varied. It's verysimple. And so you do what you're trained to do. You do what you're thereto do. And, in Vietnam, it was body count. CROWLEY : Training is what keeps you running toward the front while trucks loadedwith dead bodies pass you, going the other way. REP. CHARLES RANGEL (D), NEW YORK : It's hard to explain what training can do. Training sets your mind torespond not to common sense and judgment, but to training. You reallydon't have time to think: I'm going the wrong way. I should be going theother way. CROWLEY : Later, when he was wounded and trapped behind enemy lines in Korea, StaffSergeant Charlie Rangel led 40 men, fighting their way to safety. He wona Bronze Star. RANGEL : If you're killing people, it's out of fear, not really, in my opinion,out of bravery. Nobody is looking for medals. Everyone wants to liveanother day. CROWLEY : Don't misunderstand. Rangel, Cunningham, Ridge and Hagel are all proud,decorated combat veterans. It's just, a decade later, killing stilltroubles the soul. Maybe that's a good thing. (on camera): Did you do itagain? CUNNINGHAM : I did. I shot down four more MiGs. And I often told myself -- I saidthat, if I ever get used to this, I shouldn't be here. CROWLEY (voice-over) : Candy Crowley, CNN, Washington. WOODRUFF : Remarkable interviews and a reminder that what these men and women aregoing through right now in Iraq, they will remember for the rest of theirlives. That's our coverage this hour.

===========Input: New Explosions in Mosul, Baghdad TUCHMAN (voice-over) : As they get ready to head over hostile territory, 10 men aboard this AirForce HC-130 search and rescue and refueling plane start to feel theiradrenaline rushing. Who looks out for the unlikely prospect of Iraqiaircraft, and the more likely prospect of Iraqi missiles or artillery.(on camera): Does your mindset change across the border into Iraq? UNIDENTIFIED MALE : No, because I am in an area which I don't know where the enemy could beand I might get to the airplane, by the time I get out of the airplaneI'm thinking the same way. TUCHMAN : Which is? UNIDENTIFIED MALE : The hair on the back of my neck starts standing up, then something'sgoing wrong. TUCHMAN (voice-over) : As a precaution, the crew starts turning the huge plane in circles to seewhat the targets do. Ultimately it's discovered the targets are U.S.combat helicopters. Minutes later the search and rescue helicopterarrives for its refueling. Watch the flash from our night vision cameraas the plane's fuel line connects with the chopper. Both aircraft fly at125 miles per hour gingerly over enemy land. At times they are only 50feet apart with the chopper's rotor blades getting closer. Looking withthe naked eye out of the plane, the helicopter is impossible to see. Thepitch-black maneuver ends after 10 minutes. (on camera): What stopsthough - we know the Iraqis have fired sand missiles and fired AAA ataircraft all throughout this war. They haven't hit anybody, but isn't itrisky flying so low knowing they have that ammunition to fire at you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Again, we know where we're going. We know where they're at so we simplyavoid them and if for some reason they do get off a lucky shot or they dosee us, we have defensive systems on board the airplane to defeat theirammunition. TUCHMAN : We all fly with bulletproof vests in case the plane goes down. We alsofly with parachutes in case we need to get out before the plane goesdown. (voice-over): But three airmen aboard this plane have parachutesfor a different reason. They are the Pararescue jumpers, or PJs who jumpoff the plane for rescue missions. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I mean it's probably the most - the best feeling in the world knowingthat your purpose is really defined at that moment. TUCHMAN : No rescues were necessary on this sortie. The plane arrived back to basesafely. (on camera): Do you have any fear? UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Everybody has a little bit of fear but I think it's a good thing in thiscircumstance. TUCHMAN (voice-over) : This crew could be back on another mission in as few as 24 hours. TUCHMAN : This is a very busy base. We want to give you a look right now at theaircraft coming in for landings. It looks like LAX on a Sunday night andthis is what it's been like for the past 11 days. We have just watchedmultitudes of warplanes land, multitudes of warplanes take off and thismay be the busiest night of the campaign. They're expecting a total atthis particular base near the Iraqi border of 300 sorties in a 24-hourperiod ending today according to the Air Force total from all the basesand there are more than 30 bases in 12 different countries in the MiddleEast according to the Pentagon. They're saying there will be 1500 sortiesin a 24-hour period ending tomorrow. Eight hundred of those sorties willbe strike sorties using bombs and missiles so there is no slow down inthe amount of air power being used over Iraq. Wolf, back to you. BLITZER : That's a lot of bombs and missiles. Gary Tuchman in an air base near theIraq border, thanks very much, Gary Tuchman. This programming note,tomorrow at noon Eastern I'll have a special interview with the nation'stop military officer, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. GeneralRichard Myers will be my special guest on a special late addition. That'sat noon Eastern, nine A.M. Pacific tomorrow. That's Sunday and I'll beback Judy and at the top of the hour for Wolf Blitzer Reports. We'll havea complete wrap of all the day's late breaking developments. In themeantime, back to Judy Woodruff in Washington. WOODRUFF : We'll be watching you both times at the top of the hour and certainly forlate edition on Sunday. Thanks Wolf. Well, as coalition forces pushnorth, they are encountering a unique problem of combat, getting rid ofthe weapons captured from the enemy. Some of the 40,000 British troopsare kicking up a lot of dust in the Iraqi desert making sure that nothingis left behind them that could hurt them. Greg Milam is with the U.K.forces in southern Iraq. GREG MILAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT : Seemingly deserted, these battered buildings hold a deadly threat toBritish forces in Iraq. SERGEANT GEOFF BANHAM, ROYAL ENGINEERS : This is what we're coming across a lot of these, 30 mil, 60 mil, 80 mil,even 120 mil. So there's plenty still out there that will have to berecovered because they can be used. MILAM : Do you know when this place was last used? I mean do you know(UNINTELLIGIBLE) BANHAM : I'm not too sure but judging by some of this, it's been here quite a longtime so whether it's been used recently by them - there was an Intelupbeat saying that they were possibly coming back to try and get this touse against them. MILAM : Grenades, mortars, all sorts of ammunition abandoned by Iraqi soldiersbut there for the taking. The job of these Royal Engineers is to clearthis and many other mountains of armaments and destroy them. Some are toounstable to be moved and have to be blown up on the spot. The rest iscarried way out into the desert. And today's parts in this conflict, thiskind of work becomes more and more important. With the coalition forcesmoving forward the last thing they want is weaponry like this lurkingbehind them. CAPTAIN ANDY GOOCH, ROYAL ENGINEERS : With the amounts of ammunition and weapons left about, if they'd usedthose systems, that amount of weapon it would have given us aconsiderable amount of trouble trying to take the positions. MILAM : With much of this weaponry there is only one safe thing to do. No one inthe British forces here is willing to take any risks. Greg Milam, SkyNews, Southern Iraq.

===========Input: New Explosions in Mosul, Baghdad WOODRUFF : That's something to look at. Today the Pentagon is comparing suicidebombing attacks on coalition forces in Iraq to terrorism. Four U.S. Armysoldiers were killed when a suicide bomber attacked a military checkpointtoday in Najaf. CNN's Chris Plante is chasing all that down for us at thePentagon right now. Hello Chris. CHRIS PLANTE, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT : Hi, Judy. That's right. Four U.S. soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Divisionmanning a checkpoint near the town of Najaf killed today in an apparentsuicide bombing. A man driving what appeared to be a taxicab came to thecheckpoint, waved soldiers over, appeared to be having mechanicalproblems of some kind. As the soldiers approached, the man detonatedexplosives in the car killing all four of the soldiers. This is somethingthat Iraqi Vice President Ramadan had said would take place. He said thislong before the conflict ever began. He reiterated today in a pressconference in Baghdad that this would just be the beginning of this thatthey would plan on killing thousands of U.S. troops with suicide bombingsimilar to this. Also, in southern Iraq today near Basra, two members -claimed to be members of Saddam's Thataeen (ph) group surrendered to U.S.troops saying that they had been ordered to carry out suicide bombingsdown there but that they didn't want to die for the regime so they weresurrendering. At the Pentagon briefing today, General Stanley McChrystalsaid that it looked a lot like terrorism. MCCHRYSTAL : It looks and feels like terrorism and what it requires is units toconduct forced production activities which they are prepared and do allthe time but clearly when you see a tactic like this, it requires strictadherence or adjustments to your tactics, techniques and procedures toensure that places like checkpoints are not vulnerable. So it won'tchange our overall rules of engagement. It doesn't effect the operationat large but to protect our soldiers it clearly requires great care. PLANTE : So certainly an unpleasant development today Judy and another item on thedocket over here today is the failure of a number of cruise missiles.Tomahawk land detect missiles being from launched from ships in theeastern Mediterranean and in the Red Sea have suffered a number offailures. The Pentagon says a total of seven of the cruise missiles havefailed crashing in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia. No injuries reported. Themissiles are programmed so that they don't detonate until they reachtheir target. If they go astray, then the warheads never arm but claimingthat it's about one percent of the warheads. They've fired 675 or sotomahawk land detect missiles from ships and seven of those have failed.Judy ... WOODRUFF : Chris, very quickly, new information from the Pentagon today about anyconcerns they have about Saddam Hussein's ongoing air defense capability? PLANTE : Well, no major concern. The Pentagon says that they do have air dominanceas they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there arecertain areas and only certain areas of downtown Iraq where battlemanagement radars linked to surface to air missiles are still in tact.The reason that they're still in tact according to today's briefing wasthat they had not turned them on and as long as they don't turn them on,the U.S. has trouble locating them. They assure us that as soon as theydo start turning on these radars that they'll take those out too andfinish the job in terms of airspace over Baghdad.Judy ... WOODRUFF : All right. We're paying attention to all those details for us, ChrisPlante at the Pentagon. You're looking at live pictures of Baghdad wherethere have been more strikes, more bombs dropped, more missiles thisevening and of course as always, CNN keeping a close eye, a close watch,a close listen on what's going on in Baghdad.

===========Input: New Explosions in Mosul, Baghdad DAVID BOWDEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT : House clearance Royal Marine style, troops from (UNINTELLIGIBLE) commandotask to seek out the last pockets of Iraqi resistance in Umm Qasr go inhard to arrest suspected regime sympathizers and search for weapons. It'snot pretty and there's no please and thank you but for the Marines, everydoor potentially hides a gunman and when your life is on the line,manners go out the window. The Iraqis arrested looked bemused (ph) andplead innocence but with many militia here, pretending to surrender onlyto open fire on their captors later, first impressions can be deceptiveand lethal. This patrol did find hidden weapons. They're not the firstand they're unlikely to be the last. The Marines believe they have a firmhold on Umm Qasr right now but they can't afford to slack in their gripand allow those who are hostile to the coalition forces to regroup andbegin again their cycle of violence. The Marines with their snipers havenow snipers have now spread their area of operations north to include thetown of Umm Kiou (ph). As in Umm Qasr before it, they're here to clearout the opponents to regime change. A man in this vehicle took a pot shotat the commandos. It was a painful and bloody mistake. MAJOR ROB MACGOWAN, ROYAL MARINES : We sent in one of our companies of about 100 men in here this morning andwe took about 12 or 13 prisoners, three or four enemy were injured andthey've now been flown out and we're treating them including a man who isalmost dead with a gunshot wound to the chest. We've now evacuated themout and the enemy now have either fled or they've been captured. BOWDEN : The Royal Marines are satisfied they are in control of this small cornerof Iraq. Their task now is to keep it that way. David Bowden in southernIraq.

===========Input: New Explosions in Mosul, Baghdad WOODRUFF : That report filed just a short time ago. Well, CNN analyst Ken Pollackwho is with the Center for Middle East Policy at the BrookingsInstitution is with me now. He is an expert on the Iraqi military and itstactics and weapons. Ken Pollack, that resistance that we just saw theBritish troops dealing with, you and I were talking earlier today. Thestory the last few days has been the surprising level of resistance butyou're telling me your sense is that the coalition forces are beginningto adjust to that. KEN POLLACK, CENTER FOR MIDDLE EAST POLICY, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION : Right. I mean we're seeing one of the great advantages of U.S. andBritish forces now, Judy, which is that they're superbly trained troops.They have training in a whole variety of different missions and they'readapting. They recognize now they went in with some false assumptionsabout the kind of reception that they were going to face. The plan thatwas implemented had some inherent risks in it, risks to the supply line,risks in terms of not clearing cities and they're shifting. They'rechanging and the troops are trained well enough to be able to deal withthat. You've seen U.S. Central Command bringing up additional forces likethe 82nd Airborne Division to better deal with these long supply lines,get control over the cities and so I think that U.S. and British forcesare beginning to stabilize the battlefield. WOODRUFF : So as an onlooker, as somebody who's studied the Iraqi capabilities, isit your sense that the coalition can continue to adjust to whatever theydeal with? POLLACK : Absolutely. One of the things I think we're likely to see is that theIraqis are going to have a tougher time adapting than U.S. forces are.Typically what you've seen in the Iraqi armed forces is the change has tocome from the top. It doesn't come from the ground up. You don't haveground commanders calling back and saying hey, we'd like to try thistactic or this seems to work. Tell everybody else to do the same thing.Instead the high command has to identify a problem, come up with asolution and transmit it down. Chances are the Iraqis are going tocontinue to stick with what we've seen before, irregular forces blendingin with civilians trying to attack U.S. forces, some more of thesesuicide attacks which are going to be problematic for our troops. There'sno way around that but U.S. forces, British forces are beginning to adaptto it. WOODRUFF : I want to ask you about you mentioned coalition forces going in expectingmore support from ordinary Iraqi people. I just interviewed a gentleman,native of Iraq, who talks to his family there all the time and he saysthey live in Baghdad 20, 30, 50 of them and he said they do the view theAmericans as invaders. They hate Saddam Hussein. They don't like whathe's doing but they don't think the Americans are the answer. POLLACK : All right. Well, this is something that we've been trying to get a gripon for years, exactly what the Iraqi people feel and also that I thinkthe best evidence that we had before the attack began was that Iraqis do,they despise. They are desperate to be rid of him but by the same token,they don't like another country coming into their country to overturn thegovernment and beyond that, I think it's probably most important for mostIraqis is they're deeply suspicious of the United States. They rememberthat the United States betrayed them in 1991. The U.S. didn't finishSaddam then. President Bush - then President Bush called on them to riseup and then the U.S. did nothing and so they're deeply suspicious of whatwe have in mind. WOODRUFF : Which raises questions going forward. One last thing, Ken Pollack I wantto ask about this British officials saying that they have informationthat Saddam Hussein has fired his air defense chief. What's thesignificance of that? POLLACK : Well, if it's true and obviously we don't know just yet but if it's true,it is very significant because it's effectively the Iraqis admitting thatmany of the civilian casualties that we've seen over the last few daysmay in fact have been caused by Iraqi surface to air missiles fallingback to ground in residential areas. WOODRUFF : (INAUDIBLE) POLLACK : Exactly, in that market and I think it was pretty apparent when youlooked at the video of that market, if that had been a U.S. bomb or aU.S. cruise missile, that market would have been obliterated. Chances areit was an Iraqi surface to air missile.

===========Input: New Explosions in Mosul, Baghdad WOODRUFF : We're going to go quickly to northern Iraq now where we find CNNcorrespondent Ben Wedeman. There's been some action in that area. Nick(ph) - I mean - I'm sorry. Ben, we can make you out just barely but tellus what you've been seeing. BEN WEDEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT : Yes. Judy, you're seeing us through the night scope because basically forthe last hour we've been watching as this ridge behind me in Kalak whichof course is the front line between Iraq and Kurdish (ph) forces, we'vebeen watching as planes, planes we can hear but cannot see, have beenbombing the ridge line behind us. Five huge explosions within the spaceof less than an hour as these planes drop these massive bombs on theIraqi positions behind us. Not just Iraqi positions behind us, inaddition to that in the direction of Mosul as well which is a majornorthern Iraqi city about 28 miles to the west of me. We've also seensome massive blasts to the south as well so it appears that this bombingin this area continues and we have really seen the most intense bombingof the war in this area in the last 24 hours. Judy ... WOODRUFF : Ben, what is your best understanding of what it is on the ground that thecoalition forces are going after there? WEDEMAN : Well, basically on the ridge itself it is the most forward Iraqi armypositions and we've been watching them very closely for the last monthprior to the war to the outbreak of the war and basically these are thepositions that control this entire valley. Up there they have heavymachine guns. They have mortars. They have anti-tank guns, hundreds ofmen along this very long ridge that basically runs from the north to thesouth. In addition to that, we know that further back behind those linesin the direction of Mosul there is heavy artillery and tanks as well,this according to the people here in this area, the local Kurds who havebeen going across the lines for many years basically engaged insmuggling. Now precisely what they're hitting to the south of us isunclear but my understanding is that there are further Iraqi positions inthat direction as well. Judy ... WEDEMAN : Ben Wedeman describing coalition hits in the area where he is, the townof Kalak in northern Iraq. He just called in and we wanted to get thisreport to you right away. Ben, very - we thank you very much for that andwe'll be coming back to you as the night - as the night wears on. We'regetting close to the bottom of the hour. We're going to get someheadlines at the hour right now with Heidi Collins.

===========Input: New Explosions in Mosul, Baghdad WOODRUFF : I hope they get a little rest. When we come back, one of the many sadaspects of this war, humanitarian aid rushed to people who need it butnot everybody gets what they came for. Slowly humanitarian aid is rollinginto southern Iraq but dramatic scenes like this one of a crowd tearinginto the supplies on a convoy truck only underscores how desperate theneed is. Correspondent Martin Geissler files this report from the Iraqitown of Safwan. MARTIN GEISSLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT : As our convoy rolled through southern Iraq the desperation of the peoplehere soon became evident. In trucks and on foot they came to the town ofSafwan. These people have been without food or water supplies since thewar began. Now they are desperate. Within seconds the Kuwaiti aid workerswho had organized this trip were overpowered by the mob. These desperatescenes are exactly what the aide agencies wanted to avoid. This issurvival of the fittest. Only the healthy and strong can get to the food.The weak and the ill are left with nothing. Despite this effort to helpthe Iraqi people, resentment is never far away. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : We hate U.S. We hate British, England. We hate any state in war here. GEISSLER : What do you think about Saddam's regime? UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Saddam's very good man. GEISSLER : As the supplies ran out the mood swung from frantic to ugly. Deliverydrivers were threatened. One of the buses in our convoy was held up atknifepoint. The troops have moved into Safwan. We, as a consequence, havehad to move out. It's simply too dangerous. This is a clear indicationthat despite the coalition reassurances that this part of Iraq is safeand despite the aid being brought into the people here, it is still avery, very volatile area. Tonight here the strong are eating. The weakstill go hungry. Martin Geissler, ITV News, Safwan southern Iraq. WOODRUFF : So many different pictures we are getting from across that country. Well,they are making their voices heard at home and abroad. When we return,Americans this weekend are marching against the war and in support of thetroops. We'll check out some of the demonstrations. Here in the UnitedStates this weekend just as they did last weekend, anti-war protesterstaking to the street. In Los Angeles, the International Black Coalitionfor Peace and Justice is sponsoring a rally for peace today.Congresswoman Maxine Waters was among those scheduled to attend. In themeantime further north in California, San Francisco is the setting todayfor a rally aimed at boosting the moral of the American troops in thePersian Gulf region. CNN's Rusty Dornin is with us from San Francisco.Rusty, what sort of crowd is showing up there? RUSTY DORNIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well Judy, this is the largest group really we've seen of the support thetroops rallies that have been over the last few weeks. Of course this isthe home of the anti- war demonstrations stemming back to the Vietnam Warbut there are close to between 500 and 1,000 people. I'm getting variousestimates on the crowd. We did want to show you an interesting thinghere. Some folks are showing some solidarity with the speakers here.You're looking at some of San Francisco's police department's officers. Idid ask them why they did that. They said they were wearing skullcaps sothey decided to adopt this to show solidarity. They said the departmenthas not made any statement about whether they think that's all right ornot. This has been a very peaceful demonstration. As I said, the officersdid tell me that this is the largest pro-troops demonstration that hasever been in San Francisco since the Vietnam War. So far, very peaceful.As I said, there have been a few verbal exchanges but one of the mostenthusiastically received speakers here was Bessam Al-Husaini, an IraqiAmerican. He's with the Iraqi American Council. How do you feel aboutsupporting the troops? How does the Iraqi American Council feel? BESSAM AL-HUSAINI, IRAQI AMERICAN COUNCIL : Well the Iraqi American have been waiting for this liberation and theywant to get rid of Saddam so bad and they will have to take it the wayit's been offered to us. DORNIN : How do you feel though seeing pictures of civilians injured in thebombings? AL-HUSAINI : We get reports that these civilians especially in the (INAUDIBLE)population have been attacked by the Iraqi regime themselves so theycan't blame the American and said look what the American doing to us. Hewould love to see this and would draw on this emotion from the Arab worldand the European country. DORNIN : Now you said you did talk to your family in Baghdad as well and they alsoare somewhat suspicious of the Americans. AL-HUSAINI : Well, I mean the Iraqi people have been the primary victim from the wholething. Yeah my family, you know, still in fear. You know they stay in oneroom. They boarded all the - all the windows and they built with a brickone of the windows facing the street. I mean yes, you know, my prayer tothem but we can only do so much. Hopefully it will be a short war. Itwill be attack the Iraqi regime. We can live in liberty and freedom soon. DORNIN : Now I understand some of the people here have been threatened by anti-warprotesters. Have you had anyone either threatening you or ... AL-HUSAINI : No, no problem. This has been a very peaceful demonstration. DORNIN : OK. Thank you very much. AL-HUSAINI : Thank you. DORNIN : Bessam Al-Husaini here and it has been a very peaceful demonstration. Itis wrapping up this afternoon and it looks like the civil disobedienceacts by the anti-protesters are scheduled to get underway once again nextweek. Judy ...

===========Input: New Explosions in Mosul, Baghdad WOODRUFF : It was in northern Iraq today that an eight artillery round hit the siteoccupied by Kurdish fighters near Chamchamal. It happened near an areaabandoned earlier by Iraqi forces. CNN's Kevin Sites is in northern Iraq. KEVIN SITES, CNN CORRESPONDENT : This is the road to Kirkuk. A day ago it was controlled by Iraqi troopsand packed with these land mines but now we can drive far enough to seethe outskirts of Kirkuk. That's because coalition fighter jets pummeledthis Iraqi position on the hills above Chamchamal and Iraqi troops made ahasty retreat. This is what the hilltop looks like now, craters 15 feetdeep, busted bunkers and twisted metal, scattered ammunitions andtattered clothing, a helmet, a tube of toothpaste. Kurdish Peshmergafighters took their place. I'm glad to see them go this one says. Theykilled a lot of our people in Chamchamal but I feel bad for them too.Some of them were only conscripts. Some Kurds took advantage of the Iraqiretreat right away. This one took a bulldozer to a concrete portrait ofSaddam Hussein. It took about 20 minutes but finally it came topplingdown. He says after finishing the job he hopes Saddam Hussein himselfwill fall too but despite the exuberance of Kurds in the area, it's clearit's much too early to celebrate. Although the Iraqis retreated from thisarea, at dusk they fired what observers say were seven artillery roundsback at their former stronghold creating new fear and potentially newcasualties. Kevin Sites, CNN Chamchamal northern Iraq. WOODRUFF : All right and when we return, waiting here on the home front, a veryspecial reunion between a Marine and his wife. There is no greater gapprobably than that between the troops overseas and their loved ones hereat home. CNN helped bridge that cassum (ph) at least temporarily betweenSergeant Craig Martin of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit and his wifeKaycee Martin in California. They talked by videophone this morning. ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR : You're eight months pregnant I believe. How has this been for you? KAYCEE MARTIN, WIFE OF SOLDIER : It's been difficult. It's hard without him. I'm doing OK but it would bemuch better if he was home with me. COOPER : If I could just ask, I mean and you know I don't want to pry so anytime Iask something you don't want to say just tell me to shut up but what isit like for you watching all this coverage? I mean watching, you know,the access. The pictures were seeing are really historic in what we areable to see. Is it more - does it make it more difficult? Does it make iteasier? K. MARTIN : It's very difficult. It's hard. The whole time though you're just sittingthere trying to catch a glimpse just to see if maybe one of the people onTV is him but you know he tells me don't watch, don't watch. You know,it's going to be difficult but like I said, it's just too hard. I want tobe able to see just to make sure that he's OK, just catch a glimpse ofhim. COOPER : How does he look to you right now? K. MARTIN : He looks all right, but dirty. SGT. CRAIG MARTIN, 15TH MARINE EXPEDITIONARY UNIT : I lost my tooth. K. MARTIN : Beautiful. Thanks. Thanks for showing me. COOPER : How'd you - how'd you lose your tooth? C. MARTIN : Sorry. COOPER : Can I ask? How did you lose your tooth? C. MARTIN : When we came across the bridge, the enemy launched some 155 artilleryrounds at us. It came pretty close and the concussion knocked my toothout. K. MARTIN : Great. C. MARTIN : Yes. K. MARTIN : It doesn't sound like you're being too careful. C. MARTIN : It was fun though. We're all right. COOPER : Sergeant Martin I don't know if you see, your wife's sort of shaking herhead. C. MARTIN : Careful as I can be. It's all good. COOPER : Sergeant Martin, is there anything else ... C. MARTIN : I love you. COOPER : Is there anything else you would like to say either to your wife or toall the people who are watching this? I know this awkward, you know,doing this on TV and I hate to put you in this position but feel free. C. MARTIN : Yeah. I've got a couple of things real quick. To my old man, this is nota distraction. To my wife, we'll be home soon and I love you. That's allI've got to say. COOPER : Well that says a lot. Kaycee, anything else you want to say? K. MARTIN : I love you very much. I miss you very much. Everyone is praying for youand I just want you to come home safe and soon so you could see our newbaby. C. MARTIN : One more thing, you look really beautiful right now. K. MARTIN : Thanks. I'd like to say the same to you. C. MARTIN : That's stylish. Don't worry. We'll take it home. K. MARTIN : Well, just come home soon. C. MARTIN : Without a doubt. K. MARTIN : --- Well, just come home soon. C. MARTIN : I'll try baby. WOODRUFF : A little embarrassing for us to watch. It's got to be difficult talkingto your loved one in front of thousands and thousands of people ontelevision, millions. Well, in addition to the baby on the way, theMartins also have a three-year-old daughter. And that is it for thishour. I'm Judy Woodruff in Washington. Wolf Blitzer's report starts rightnow.

===========Input: War in Iraq WALTER RODGERS, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : The situation here appears to be increasingly tense. A few moments ago,out on the horizon, not very far ahead of the U.S. Army's 3rd Squadron,7th Cavalry, we heard more than a few explosions. The U.S. Army's 3rdSquadron, 7th Cavalry has compiled a rather extraordinary record in thepast several days. It was the first unit to cross the Euphrates River andthen punch northward to within 60 miles of Baghdad. It was the Army whichassigned me to the 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry, and that was extremelyfortuitous. It was like sitting in a poker game and drawing four aces,because this is a crack unit. It's the tip of the tip of the spear. We'vehad an absolutely terrific story, pushing forward north toward Baghdad.Seventy-two hours of that was under constant fire coming at us from bothsides of the road. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : We just heard an incoming -- what the hell! UNIDENTIFIED MALE : No, no, I don't know what it is. RODGERS : Recall Winston Churchill's old quote, "There's nothing so exhilarating asbeing shot at and missed." What you try to do is stay calm and continueyour broadcasting. The worst thing you can do, either as a soldier or asa war correspondent is panic. We're hearing incoming. We're not sure whatit is. We see some stuff in the sky. We may have to break this off. Ithink we're going to break off this live shot for the time being. We'renot sure what we see up there. Goodbye. We've got to dive for vehicles,we think. See you. Bye. We have under heavy fire for the past couple ofmiles. Mostly small arms fire, but the sand storm has enabled the Iraqisto come very close to the road, and if I sound a little nervous, it'sbecause we're in the soft skin vehicle and everybody else is in armor.We'd like to now show you what we call Old Betsy (ph), a re-used,secondhand U.S. Army Humvee that we've been traveling with. Any bulletwill pass through it, even a .22 caliber bullet. You can see our bodyarmor draped on the door. This is what we've literally been living in.This is the kitchen, when we're down, and we're very fortunate, becausewe've got a teapot. That's my cubby hole. It's extraordinary cramped,because (UNINTELLIGIBLE) sandbag the floor, in case we hit a mine. That'sall the space I have to eat and sleep in. You don't sleep. You reallydon't sleep out here. Of course, you're on an adrenaline high, but racingacross the desert, you know that you're traveling toward the jaws of whatcould be a major military battle. You have to realize, they've beenriding along, bouncing along in these tanks for probably six or morehours now. And if you ride inside that tank, it is like riding in thebowels of a dragon. They roar, they screech. The hardest part of the tripis personal discomfort. We cannot tell you the levels of personaldiscomfort we've experienced. The extraordinary sandstorms, the bittercold nights. The most uncomfortable thing is having to sleep sitting upin a Humvee with sandbags under your feet, your knees at your chin.That's excruciatingly uncomfortable, not something that you would wish onanybody but a contortionist. Let me give you an example of what the dustlike. Look at this. We have been through days of dust like that. The U.S.Army's 7th Cavalry has just taken three Iraqi prisoners of war. Actually,they're very close, that is to say, no more than 40 yards away, but thedust and sand are blowing so badly you're getting these vague images.It's like being in a blizzard, except unfortunately, the sand doesn'tmelt as the snow does. What we eat is what the Army calls MREs, mealsready to eat. And I must say, they're pretty darn good. And of course,everybody fights for the best ones. The treats are things like theM&amp;Ms and the breakfast toasties. The Army is eating much, much betterthan the grandfathers of these soldiers did and the great grandfathers ofthese soldiers in the Second World War. Let me hold the camera and showyou my crew. On camera left is Charlie Miller (ph), he's been our superband intrepid cameraman. On my right is Jeff Barweis (ph), a brilliantsatellite engineer. That's the crew which really brings you thesepictures. The pictures you're seeing are absolutely phenomenal. These arelive pictures of the 7th Cavalry racing across the desert. You've neverseen battlefield pictures like these before. What you're watching here istruly historic television and journalism. CROWLEY : Walter Rodgers with the 3-7th. Just ahead we'll have the latest ontoday's suicide bombing in Israel. A report from CNN's Kelly Wallace whenwe return.

===========Input: War in Iraq CROWLEY : We will be back later on the war in Iraq. But first, we want to gosomewhere else in the region to tell you that dozens were injured todayin the first suicide bombing in Israel in three weeks. CNN's KellyWallace reports on today's attack in Netanya. KELLY WALLACE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera) : It had been very quiet inside Israel since the start of the U.s.-led waragainst Iraq. Many Israelis were fearing that quiet would come to an end.And it did on this day. Police say a suicide bomber blew himself upoutside this cafe, called The London Cafe, earlier Sunday afternoon. Wecan show you some pictures from earlier Sunday. People here tell us thecafe was filled with people enjoying the spring weather. Many here thoughsay they are relieved only one person dead, the suicide bomber. Dozens,though, injured, including some Israeli soldiers, because according to aneyewitness, he said many soldiers were here also enjoying the springweather. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Then it was big bomb. And many soldier. Two soldiers were down here. Manyblood. Many people skip from here. Big paranoia. WALLACE : There had been many terrorist attacks here in Netanya, including thedeadliest suicide bombing ever in Israel almost exactly a year ago, March27, at the Park Hotel during Passover, 29 people killed in that attack.As for this attack, the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad isclaiming responsibility. According to a leaflet from the group obtainedby CNN, the group says the attack was to show the union of Palestinianswith the people of Iraq. The group is also claiming that Islamic Jihadmilitants are already inside Iraq to carry out attacks against U.S. andBritish forces. Israel has been on a heightened state of alert since thestart of the U.S.-led war against Iraq. And now many Israelis fear theycould see more attacks like the one they saw here today as the militarycampaign against Saddam Hussein continues. I'm Kelly Wallace, CNN,reporting from Netanyahu, Israel. CROWLEY : A baseball legend rallies the troops.

===========Input: Push to Baghdad Begins; POW Safe in Army's Care WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR : Hi, Judy. Thank you very much. As of an hour or so ago, we got word fromthe battlefield that U.S. forces were just 15 miles away from thesouthern edge of Baghdad. And they may be even closer right now. Thetoughest fight, though, may lie ahead in the heart of the Iraqi capital.Pentagon sources say the first phase of the final push into Baghdad isnow under way. U.S.-led forces were able to press farther north afterdefeating Iraqi Republican Guard units at Karbala and Kut (ph). Ourembedded reporters say the two-pronged advance appears to be movingfaster than commanders expected. The Pentagon says two of the RepublicanGuard divisions defending Baghdad are no longer credible forces. Scenesfrom Najaf may also be bolstering the troops' spirit. Iraqis whoinitially were cautious when U.S. forces arrived in Najaf ended cheeringthem on, shaking their hands and patting their backs. U.S. Army's 7thCavalry is in the forefront of U.S. troops since they first left Kuwaitand crossed directly into the Iraqi desert. Our Walter Rodgers isembedded with the unit's 3rd Squadron, which is leading the 3rd InfantryDivision's march toward the Iraqi capital. WALTER RODGERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT : Throughout the day, as the U.S. Army 7th Cavalry punched northward in thegeneral direction of Baghdad, we have seen huge convoys of supply troopsmoving ever northward. Indeed, all the arrows on the Army's map seem tobe pointing in the direction of the southern suburbs of Baghdad. Earlierin the day, the 1st Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division took Karbalawith a minimum of fight. And then the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd InfantryDivision secured the town of Karbala. Additionally, the 7th Cavalry haspushed onward in the general direction of Baghdad. Yesterday we wereabout 50 miles from the southern suburbs of Baghdad. We have perhaps havethat distance. Throughout the day, we have watched the 3rd InfantryDivision bring in prisoners of war. Iraqi soldiers glad the war is overfor them, perhaps 100 at a time. There were times when the 7th Cavalryitself got into some skirmishes as it pushed forward, again in thedirection of Baghdad. There was a bit of a firefight when the 7th Cavalrycame upon three Soviet vintage 20- millimeter anti-aircraft guns, ack-ackguns. The Iraqi unit in possession of those guns fired mortars in thedirection of the 7th Cavalry. The Apache troop opened its tank guns,opened its own mortars, decimated that unit, put it out of existence andprobably killed some 20 Iraqis in the process. This as it continues topush ever closer towards the southern suburbs of Baghdad. Walter Rodgers,CNN, with the U.S. 7th Cavalry in the Iraqi desert. BLITZER : And it's a similar story from CNN's Karl Penhaul who is now just milesfrom the southern outskirts of the Iraqi capital. He's embedded with theU.S. Army's 11th Attack Helicopter Regiment. Here's his report just fileda few minutes ago. KARL PENHAUL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : The speed as they push to Baghdad seems to have gathered pace overnightand in the course of this morning. In fact, it's going much faster thanmany of the U.S. commanders on the ground predicted. CAPT. BRIAN MCCORT, PILOT : The intensity it's very quick moving, very fluid battle. The armor, andmechanized infantry, and artillery pieces and personnel on the ground aremoving at rapid speeds. PENHAUL : Overnight and early this morning, the tanks and Bradley fighting vehiclesof the 3rd Infantry Division backed by the Apache attack helicopters ofthe 11th Aviation Regiment punched through the Republican Guard defensesin and around Karbala. They were then able to advance far north of thatcity and, as we speak, U.S. commanders tell me that elements of the 3rdInfantry Division are now literally just a few miles from Baghdad.

Britain reports 6 of its troops have beenkilled by combat, 19 more in nonhostile action and 2 deaths have not beenclassified. Iraq does not report on its military casualties, but Iraqiofficials say 420 civilians have been killed and about 4,000 injured.U.S. Central Command says 4,500 Iraqis have been taken prisoner. SevenAmericans remain prisoners of war in Iraq and 15 Americans are listed asmissing in action. One less than yesterday after that dramatic rescue ofPrivate First Class Jessica Lynch. Judy, in the next hour, on our special"WOLF BLITZER REPORTS," I'm going to be speaking live to her olderbrother who is in the Army, her younger sister who wants to be in theArmy, just around the same time as Jessica is going to be arriving atRamstein, the air base in Germany for some serious medical treatment.That's all coming up on our special edition of "WOLF BLITZER REPORTS" atthe top of the hour. Judy, back to you. WOODRUFF : All right, Wolf, and we will be watching. Thanks very much. Well, at thePentagon briefing this afternoon, officials describing several units ofthe Republican Guard as effectively no longer being a credible fightingforce. Let's get the very latest from the Pentagon for the overall warpicture as they see it. Our Jamie McIntyre our senior military affairscorrespondent is with us now. Hello, again, Jamie. JAMIE MCINTYRE, CNN SNR. MILITARY AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT : Well Judy, the Pentagon is beginning to see positive signs that it hadn'tseen for awhile. First of all, as we saw just a few moments ago on CNN,the pictures of some of the actual happy Iraqi citizens welcoming U.S.troops, that taking place in Najaf. Also the Pentagon is seeing lighterthan expected resistance indicating at least that they may have reallyseriously degraded those Republican Guard divisions before the U.S.troops arrived, both in Karbala and also in Al Kut. They met lighter thanexpected resistance. But the Pentagon officials stress that as they closein on Baghdad, this becomes the real dangerous part as they enter thatso- called red zone where Saddam Hussein is believed to have given hiscommanders authority to use chemical weapons, and that use of chemicalweapons remains a real fear at the Pentagon. MAJOR GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL, JOINT CHIEFS, VICE DIR. : We are not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it in acoup de mains, or anything like that. So, in regard to that, we arepaying great attention to their ability to defend on the ground. They mayjust suddenly be effective on the ground. Additionally, their ability touse chemical and biological weapons, they've proven it historically. Webelieve they have the capability now. Clearly, as we threaten the core ofthe regime, which Baghdad and Tikrit represent, we believe that thelikelihood of them using those weapons goes up. BLITZER : In less than 24 hours, the U.S. 101st Airborne Division has driven IraqiFedayeen fighters from the key city of Najaf, pushed north in aseveral-pronged attack. The Army's 3rd Infantry has punched throughKarbala, meeting only light resistance from the Medina Republican Guard,and moving along highway nine within 25 miles of Baghdad. At the sametime, the Marines from the 1st Division have secured a key Tigris Rivercrossing near Al Kut and reported to have essentially destroyed thecombat fighting ability of that light infantry Baghdad division that wassupposed to be providing defense down there. At the U.S. Central Commandbriefing this morning at the forward headquarters in Doha, Qatar, GeneralVincent Brooks said that the U.S. would be continuing to approachBaghdad. He said, quote, "The dagger is clearly pointed at the heart ofthe regime now, and it will remain pointed at it," he said, "until theregime is gone." Judy. WOODRUFF : Jamie, these descriptions of the weakening of the Republican Guard beginto bring back memories of the first Gulf War 12 years ago. Is there achance that coalition forces could, at this point, be overestimating thestrength of what's left of the opposition? MCINTYRE : Well, they might be. And that might be a good thing. They are taking itvery cautiously. No one, again, they stress the most dangerous part ofthis could be ahead. Could be urban combat. Could involve chemicalweapons. Could be the most loyal fighters left as they draw into Baghdad.Could be a very dangerous time. They also are careful to point out thateven while they say that the division has been destroyed, they don't meanevery single person has been killed. Simply that its combat effectivenesshas been eliminated - Judy. WOODRUFF : We notice they said they did not want to use the word destroyed, in fact,they said let others do that. Jamie McIntyre at the Pentagon.

===========Input: Push to Baghdad Begins; POW Safe in Army's Care WOODRUFF : Well, rescued American prisoner of war Jessica Lynch is expected toarrive at Ramstein air base in Germany just about an hour from now. CNNwill have live coverage of her arrival. Lynch was rescued in a daringraid by U.S. forces on the Saddam hospital in Nasiriya. This nightscopevideo shows troops carrying the 19-year-old Army private to a Blackhawkhelicopter. We know, though, that 11 bodies were also recovered in thisoperation, and military officials say they are working now to identifythem. When she's in Germany, Lynch will be treated for bullet wounds andbroken bones. She's reported to be in stable condition. She and more thana dozen other members of her Army maintenance unit were ambushed nearNasiriya more than a week ago. WOODRUFF : Meantime in Palestine, West Virginia, there is a lot of joy over the newsof Jessica Lynch's rescue. Her father, mother and other family memberssay they never gave up hope, despite their fears of what might havehappened. And they say they are grateful to her rescuers. GREG LYNCH, JR, JESSICA LYNCH'S BROTHER : I can't really say how the military is functioning over there because I'mnot there. But they are doing a job, you know, I don't know the thoughtsof the soldiers, the men and women that went into that building andbrought her out. They are heroes in my book. WOODRUFF : West Virginia's United States Senator Robert Byrd is also praising therescue. SEN. ROBERT BYRD (D), WEST VIRGINIA : She was rescued in a daring effort by the brave Army rangers and NavySEALS. And today she is safe. Safe. Safe once again. Her state of WestVirginia is relieved. Her community is exuberant. Her family isoverjoyed. I spoke with Jessica Lynch's father last evening and sharedwith him our thoughts and good wishes. WOODRUFF : Senator Byrd called the rescue miraculous. We'll have more on the marchtoward Baghdad after a quick break. We preview the potential battlesahead and the strategies in play when we check in with our militaryanalyst.

===========Input: Push to Baghdad Begins; POW Safe in Army's Care WOODRUFF : U.S. forces moving ever closer to Baghdad, but military officials saythey are not counting on capitulation. For a look at what might lie aheadfor U.S. forces, let's turn to our Miles O'Brien in Atlanta. MILES O'BRIEN, CNN ANCHOR : Thank you very much, Judy. To help guide us through all this discussionabout red zones, and daggers and exactly what is the strength of theRepublican Guard, we turn to Colonel Patrick Lang. He's retired with theUnited States Army. He spent some time in the Defence IntelligenceAgency, among other things. Colonel, good to have you with us. COL. PAT LANG (RET,), U.S. ARMY : You're welcome. O'BRIEN : What do you suppose right now would be the governor on the forwardadvance? Is it the Republican Guard or is it the U.S. and coalitionsupply lines? Or both? LANG : Well, they are close enough up to Baghdad now so that the supply lineissue is probably not a big one since they had time to restock, food,fuel and ammunition. So, probably the main thing is combing through therubble that the air force has left of these Republican Guard divisions tomake sure there are no strong points that you leave behind, that couldthreaten your lines of supply once they get past. Once they are satisfiedthey are through all that, I would imaging there will be a pause whilethey start to reconnoiter into Baghdad, probing hard to see how muchresistance there really is. O'BRIEN : Well, let me ask you that. First of all, I just wanted to tell viewerswhere we just took our satellite imagery. This is that Karbala area whichis about 50 miles from Baghdad. Baghdad is roughly in that direction fromthere. We know the vanguard is supposedly as close as 15 miles. One ofthe next key points along the way here is Saddam international airport.Do you suppose that is a key target right now? LANG : Oh, I'm sure it is. I mean a feature of that importance would always besomething you'd want to hold. And besides, as soon as you get control ofit you'd be able to start using it for air operations, and put a surveyteam in there as soon as it's secured, and then start using it forhelicopter operations, haul forward some big bladders of fuel to refuelhelicopters and rearm them and things like that. And if the frontstabilizes between there and the downtown Baghdad, they'll start using itfor a fixed wing aircraft as well. O'BRIEN : Now, as you go from Saddam International Airport into town you see thereare some big, wide divided highways there. Control of these highways willbe crucial won't it? LANG : Yeah, these are the high-speed approaches into the heart of the city andarmored forces like the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division just lovehigh-speed approaches. They will try to go down those things, cutting thecity up into sectors as best they can, and then work on the specificsectors of the city they think are a key terrain. I would think,probably, various facilities as well as major government buildings thatthey need to control to set up a new government. O'BRIEN : It's a big city, about the size of Philadelphia or thereabouts. Some havesaid Chicago is a good analogy. Tremendous amount of force needed tocontrol a city of that source, or am a wrong? LANG : Well, it depends on the attitude of the populous, which is not clear yet.If the population, in fact, or at least a big part of them like the Shiahalf of the population, if they want to be liberated, then you cancontrol them with a fairly small force. If, in fact, a lot of people inthe city don't want to be liberated and you're never going to know thatuntil you try, then you're going to need a much larger force, and wemight end up waiting a couple of weeks for reinforcements. O'BRIEN : Based on what you've seen so far, what is your sense of that? The Shiasare a bit gun shy, if you will, in the south because of what happened in1991. They rose up, didn't get American support. Do you suppose it willbe a different story in Baghdad? Is there a lot of latent hatred forSaddam Hussein that will come out? LANG : Yes, there is, but these folks are going to be mighty cautious. They havea long history of being kicked around by the Sunni Arab population ofcentral Iraq. And they don't have any particular reason to trust us, sofar. So they'll wait and see what happens. It's the other people in thecity you have to worry about, who are ethnically much the same as theSaddam Hussein regime. And their behavior right now is unpredictable. O'BRIEN : Colonel Patrick Lang, retired, United states Army, thanks for yourinsights. A man who has been to Baghdad many times and can tell us withgreat knowledge exactly what it's going to be like to fight on thoseavenues in that sprawling city of Baghdad - Judy. WOODRUFF : Always helps Miles to hear a voice of experience. Thank you and thanks toColonel Lang. When we come back, hopes rising among investors. That meansstocks were up today on Wall Street as they look at the progress of thewar in Iraq. We're going to check in with Rhonda Schaffler at the stockexchange in just a moment.

===========Input: Push to Baghdad Begins; POW Safe in Army's Care WOODRUFF : As coalition forces push ahead in their march toward Baghdad, they haveencountered some resistance in the Shiite holy city of Karbala. ButAmerican troops and their superior technology have turned out to be a keyfactor in the fighting there. And to the south, British forces continuetheir attack on targets around Basra. ITN correspondent Tim Ewartreports. TIM EWART, ITN CORRESPONDENT : These are soldiers of the U.S. 3rd Infantry, fighting near Karbala,southwest of Baghdad. They are facing Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard,his finest soldiers. But for all the resistance, coalition aircraft rulethe skies and coalition technology is overwhelmingly superior. U.S.commanders believe the Republican Guard is a doomed force. BRIG. GEN. VINCENT BROOKS, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND : We will approach Baghdad. The dagger is clearly pointed at the heart ofthe regime right now and will remain pointed at it until the regime isgone. EWART : To the south, more black smoke over the town of Basra. British troopscontrol the outskirts of the town, and today destroyed another buildingthey said housed Iraqi fighters. There is much fear here of the Saddamloyalists who still hold sway in Basra and of the invading troops waitingat the gates. (on camera): The Americans are racing towards Baghdad, theBritish still seem anxious to make their progress here as measured aspossible. Basra will fall. But there may first be fighting in thecapital, 250 miles to the north. Tim Ewart, ITV News, southern Iraq. WOODRUFF : From the south to the north in the rolling hills of northern Iraq,coalition air strikes targeted Iraqi positions today in what's beencalled a ferocious bombardment. It happened outside the oil-rich city ofKirkuk. CNN's Brent Sadler is there. BRENT SADLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT : A back road leading to Kirkuk, the heartland of northern Iraq's oilwealth. A road that's now in the hands of Iraqi Kurdish forces. Occupyingthese positions, strattled along a crescent-shaped front line east ofKirkuk. This land fell into Iraqi-Kurdish hands without a shot beingfired. Iraqi soldiers fled these positions in a hurry, under theonslaught of coalition bombing. This is the end of the road for Kurdishforces manning this remote checkpoint. But with special permission, theylet us through. We are now between the lines, a no man's land ofabandoned Iraqi bunkers and an unnerving silence, broken by the roar ofwarplanes and the distant surge of air strikes. This territory is withineasy artillery range of Saddam Hussein's forces and circling Kirkuk. Theoil capital of northern Iraq is visible behind me, just over there, aharmless flare of burning gases is easily identifiable. Iraq's preciousoil field remain intact. Also intact, Kirkuk's defenses, in the distanthaze. Iraq's armed opposition, including these Kurds, waits on thesidelines to join the fray, if America asks. PRIME MINISTER BARHAM SALEH, KURDISTAN REGIONAL GOV. : This is about freedom for Iraq. This is about the liberation of Iraq, andwe Iraqis must shoulder the responsibility of helping in the process ofliberation. SADLER : And, says the Iraqi opposition, in winning this war.

===========Input: Push to Baghdad Begins; POW Safe in Army's Care WOODRUFF : With U.S. forces rolling closer and closer to Baghdad, the military seemsto be zeroing in on the ground war. But, as it has from the beginning,air power remains an important part of the battle. Let's check in withCNN's Gary Tuchman at an air base near Iraq. Gary you've seen itfirsthand from the first moments. GARY TUCHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well, that's right, Judy. In two weeks after the air war began, there isno let-up and no effective response from the Iraqis. According to the AirForce, at any given time, there are more 200 coalition aircraft eitherover Iraq, flying to Iraq or flying from Iraq. We come to you from a basenear the Iraqi border. Many pilots are flying these A-10 attack planesbehind me. They also fly F-16s. There are also Marine FA-18s and MarineHeriers at this base. We can tell you that a lot of pilots of this baseare not flying to another base in Iraq. It's a base that was taken overby the coalition last week. And we spent part of the day at that base.And when you arrive there, you are greeted in a sense by Saddam Hussein. TUCHMAN : This is Talil, Iraq. The Talil Air Base. But the are no more Iraqis here,the coalition took over this base last week. It's now a major stagingpoint. You know you are in Iraq when you drive down the road coming intothe base and see the portrait of Saddam Hussein. What's happen is themilitary personnel who have arrived here have taken out their markers andare writing messages on Saddam Hussein's portrait. You can see the mainone here on the bottom and also here messages like, we won, April 1,2003. Want to give you a look. There's a lot of security personnel here.You can look over there and you can see the military vehicles. These areAir Force Security Forces with their rifles patrolling the entrance.There is a lot of fighting in this area. We're near the town of Nasiriya.But this base now is considered secure enough to make it a major stagingpoint for the coalition. TUCHMAN : A short time ago we talked to a pilot at this base who has been to thatIraqi base and he too says he has signed that mural right on SaddamHussein's sash. After he told us that, we asked him during his missions,and he's flown about 30 in the last two weeks, we asked him does he stillhave any artillery being fired at him? UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Yesterday I was up just south of Baghdad by 30 miles and we were fightingSA-2s and SA-6s and AAA on the ground. So they're still out there. Butthe air power and the air package that we take to the fight, we continueto be effective. And we attrit the Medina forces down to less than 50percent. And when we put our power punch to them and then the Army andthe Marines move forward it's a very effective, coordinated effort. TUCHMAN : Lieutenant Colonel Webb (ph) is telling us he has a mission this veryevening. We want to tell you the Air Force has just informed us thatbetween this morning and tomorrow morning, it will fly 1,900 sorties intoIraq. A total over the last two weeks now of close to 24,000 sorties.Before we go, one more thing we want to tell you about, superstitions.Military people are very superstitious, like many of us are. Here at thisparticular base they get their MREs, their MREs are their Meals Ready toEat. They come in a bag. And when you get an MRE you get your meal andyou get a little treat with it. What a lot of people here at this basedo, when their treat happens to be this one, this is the candy calledCharms, many of the people refuse to eat their Charms. They consider it agood luck charm to keep their Charms in their clothes and not to eatthem. So one little superstitious tale for you, Judy. Back to you. WOODRUFF : Well, I'm one of those who thinks that we need to pay attention to oursuperstitions. Gary, one another quick question for you. That air basethat coalition forces have now taken control of near Nasiriya. Are youable to say, are they actually using it or getting much use out of it? TUCHMAN : What they are doing, Judy, some of these A-10s behind me go there torefuel, to stage operations further north. They also fly these HH-60helicopters, they're the search and rescue helicopters used in case theyhave to search and find somebody on the ground. They stage there andrefuel. But right now, none of them are permanently based there, althoughthe plan is for that to eventually happen. WOODRUFF : All right, Gary Tuchman with some Charms. You saw him holding it. I willbe talking with a ranking member of the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee, Senator Joe Biden, just ahead, for his take on how the war isgoing. Could Tony Blair be in line for a gold medal? Tales of how some inCongress want to honor the British prime minister.

===========Input: Iraqis Mistakenly Believe Soldiers Have Sights on Sacred Landmark WOLF BLITZER, CNN ANCHOR : Thanks very much, Judy. With the power out now in Baghdad, we're gettingword that loudspeakers have been blaring in the Iraqi capital, urgingcitizens to go to the international airport there, presumably to defendit against coalition forces. Now that armored columns of U.S.-led troopshave reached the outskirts of Baghdad, eyewitnesses report fighting andshelling around Saddam Hussein International Airport. In the final pushto Baghdad, U.S. forces face limited resistance from Iraqi troops. Butthe Pentagon believes some Iraqi Republican Guard units have withdrawn tothe capital for what could be their last stand. Farther south in Basra,smoke rose over the city as coalition vehicles moved in today. Britishforces say they're consolidating their position in Basra's key suburbs.And in northern Iraq, Kurdish political leaders and members of the Iraqiopposition are engaged in talks with U.S. military commanders. Theyreportedly are exploring the option of joining forces against SaddamHussein. Coalition forces launched their latest advances toward Baghdadin the pre-dawn hours today, heading toward the Iraqi capital from thesoutheast and the southwest. The forces encountered limited resistancealong the way and are now poised for the final assault not far from theedge of the city. Reporter Carl Dinnon of Britain's ITN filed thisreport. CARL DINNON, ITN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : Baghdad is now within striking distance as troops make their final thrustthrough the desert. Wrecked armor by the sides of the road suggests therehas been some Iraqi opposition. But by and large, the Republican Guardhas either been destroyed or has withdrawn. And the way seems to be openfor coalition forces to close in on the city's southern limits. Atdaybreak, U.S. troops pushed through the outskirts of Karbala on the roadto Baghdad, capturing a key bridge on the Euphrates River. Meanwhile,coalition commanders posted American special forces were now operating atwill. These dramatic pictures show a raid on a presidential palace lessthan 60 miles from Baghdad. It seems to have been abandoned, but theUnited States said it was still on the trail of Saddam and his closestcircle. BRIG. GEN. VINCENT BROOKS, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND : We remain cautiously optimistic. We don't think that the fighting is overyet, and so there are still options available to the regime, includingthe use of weapons of mass destruction. We take that very seriously. Wetake it in a sober fashion. And at the same time, we remain prepared tocontinue operations. DINNON : The Americans say they've destroyed two divisions of the elite RepublicanGuard. (on camera): The Medina division, which is one of the toughestoutfits in the Republican Guard is now down to 10 percent of its fightingstrength. That means it's practically inoperative. Others are down to 50percent, but there's still one or two divisions around 75, 80, 90 percentof their fighting strength, and they could still put up very stiffresistance, indeed, when the American forces get en masse to Baghdaditself. (voice-over): The noose appears to be tightening on SaddamHussein. The question is, how desperate he will get before he is finallytoppled. Carl Dinnon, ITV News, Iraq. BLITZER : In the southern city of Najaf, home to one of Islam's holiest sites,moments of tension that could have gone either way earlier today. Armedcoalition soldiers moving toward a venerated mosque at the behest of aMuslim cleric. Angry locals who did not understand their intentionsclearly showed their intentions as well. CNN's Ryan Chilcote is in Najaf.We're going to get to him shortly. But Judy Woodruff, back in Washington,has breaking news -- Judy.

===========Input: Iraqis Mistakenly Believe Soldiers Have Sights on Sacred Landmark WOODRUFF : Wolf, we're going to break in here, because the parents of Jessica Lynch,who live in Palestine, West Virginia, are before the microphones, I'mtold, just about to talk with reporters. They're walking toward thepress. Let's listen. GREG LYNCH SR., JESSICA LYNCH'S FATHER : Good afternoon. We appreciate y'all coming out for what you're doing forJessie and all of the other troops that are missing. We've been waitingall day word from the doctors, and they have successively done onesurgery on her. There will be other surgeries to do that. It's going totake time and patience. DEE LYNCH, JESSICA'S MOTHER : But she's great and she's doing good. G. LYNCH : She's in real good spirits. We talked to her. D. LYNCH : We talked to her before the surgery, we talked to her after the surgery,and she's doing good. Can't you think? G. LYNCH : Yes, a bunch, but my mind's blank. The doctor has completed one surgeryon her back. They have released the pressure on a nerve, and realignedall the disks and put plates and stuff in it, and that was because shedidn't have any feeling in her feet. So he, he's pretty sure right nowthat that will relieve, relieve the tension, and her feet will be able tomove. Also, we have heard and seen reports that she had multiple gunshotwounds, and knife stabbing. The doctor has not seen any of this. Helooked for the gunshot wounds for the knife stabbing, and there is noinjury whatsoever. They will do surgery again tomorrow on her legs. Shehas fractured legs and her right forearm. And we are just waiting to getthat good news too. D. LYNCH : We talked to her before and after the surgery, like I said, and she'sjust, she just sounded real good. Of course, this morning she was alittle groggy. But yet, she was good, because it was early. And then thisafternoon, after the surgery, she was our Jessie again. QUESTION : If those weren't gunshot wounds to cause the broken bones, do they knowwhat caused the fractures? G. LYNCH : They have no idea at this time what caused them. We know she's in goodspirits, because they told her they was gonna put pink casts on her legsand arms, and she had pink casts when she was in the third grade on herarm so we know she -- her mind is working good. So she's in good spirits,and we hope the surgery will go good tomorrow, just as well as it didtoday. QUESTION : Can you tell us what she said to you on the telephone? You said she wasin good spirits? Can you describe your conversation? G. LYNCH : I teased her again about the Army jeeps and she said, "I know wherethere's a bunch of that we can find." So, we know she's in good spirits. D. LYNCH : She was asking for a hairbrush. WOODRUFF : Gregory Lynch, the father of Jessica Lynch, and Jessica's mother talkingto reporters, saying they have talked to her today, both before and aftersurgery, that she says she's feeling good. They say she will be good. Butthey said the doctors did go in and apparently do some work on her spinalcord or spinal column. He said to relieve some pressure on a nerve. Theywere concerned because she didn't have feeling in her feet. They did goon to say the doctors could not find either bullet or knife entry wounds,suggesting that her broken bones came from some other source, and it isnot clear yet. Her parents said they don't know yet what caused theirdaughter's injuries.

===========Input: Iraqis Mistakenly Believe Soldiers Have Sights on Sacred Landmark WOODRUFF : Back now to the battlefront and to the southern cityof Najaf, home to one of Islam's holiest sites, moments of tension thatcould have gone either way today. Armed coalition soldiers moving towarda venerated mosque at the request of a Muslim cleric, but angry localswho didn't understand what they were trying to do. CNN's Ryan Chilcote isin Najaf with the 101st Airborne. RYAN CHILCOTE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : A tip leads the Bastogne Brigade's No Slack Batallion to this parking lotin Najaf where the Fedayeen are said to have stashed weapons. The searchturns up nothing. The only resistance comes from a Volvo. The Shiapopulation seems curious and friendly but they don't get too close. Thisman agrees to be interviewed as long as his face isn't shown. The Iraqigovernment, he says, has satellite TV. Anybody could be an informer andpunish us for talking to you, even my family, he tells me in Arabic. Thetroops also keep their distance. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Yes, it's very uneasy out here. Don't know who's who. CHILCOTE : Sergeant Rod Sutton from Indiana on the corner of a street leading to thehighly sensitive Imam Ali Shrine, one of the holiest sites in the worldfor Shia Muslims. Does it make you nervous that you're so close to theAli mosque? Do you feel like you're tramping on. SGT. ROD SUTTON, BASTOGNE BRIGADE : Holy ground? CHILCOTE : Yes. SUTTON : To some extent, I feel fortunate that I'm here, because this is somethingI never would have seen before. And now that I see it I kind ofunderstand some of the history behind it. So, it makes me moreappreciative of it. To the same extent, I don't want to be invasive withthese people here. I don't want to trample on their holy ground, and Iwant to respect that as much as I can. CHILCOTE : Word comes from the grand Ayatollah Sistani that he's willing to meet theAmerican commander, but he asks first for soldiers to secure hiscompound, located halfway down the road to the mosque. No one explainsthat to the crowd. (on camera): There is no more striking example of thesensitivities that the U.S. soldiers face here than what is taking placeon the streets right up from the ah Ali mosque right now. (voice-over):Chaos as the crowd apparently believes the soldiers want to approach theshrine. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : They want to get inside the holy shrine of Imam Ali. CHILCOTE : Clerics appear with a message from the grand Ayatollah, but the messageis did drowned out. The colonel instructs his men to stay calm. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : They got to understand, he wants us here. Smile, relax. CHILCOTE : His soldiers take a knee, their weapons brought down from the readyposition. They do everything soldiers can to appear less hostile. But thepotential for confrontation remains. The commander makes the decision. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Turn around, just turn around and go. CHILCOTE : He orders his men back to their compound to await cooler heads. RyanChilcote, CNN with the 101st Airborne in Najaf, Iraq. WOODRUFF : And CNN's Nic Robertson telling us earlier, significant that the ShiaMuslim Ayatollahs, what they did, that they were cooperating withcoalition and U.S. troops, saying that that will send an important signalto Shia Muslims throughout the country. Well, U.S. officials areinvestigating two possible friendly fire incidents in which coalitionforces may have mistakenly shot at allied aircraft. In one of theincidents, a soldier was killed and several others wounded. Before wordof that death, 40 Americans had been killed by hostile fire in OperationIraqi Freedom. Eleven of them by friendly fire or in other accidents.Most of the 27 British troops killed have been victims of friendly fireor accidents. Meantime, Iraq says that 420 civilians, they say, have beenkilled during the war. And they say 4,000 injured. U.S. officials saymore than 4,000 Iraqis have been captured. Seven Americans we know remainprisoners of war in Iraq. Fifteen others are said to be still missing inaction. Well, when they do finally enter Baghdad, U.S. and coalitiontroops could face urban combat with the Republican Guard, some of whommay have withdrawn into the city. But the U.S. military is expecting toremain focused on specific targets in the Iraqi capital. Nevertheless,CNN's Miles O'Brien is with our military analyst, Lieutenant ColonelRobert Leonard, he is a Persian Gulf War veteran and a military scienceprofessor at West Virginia University -- Miles.

===========Input: Iraqis Mistakenly Believe Soldiers Have Sights on Sacred Landmark MILES O'BRIEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT : Thanks very much, Judy. And Colonel Leonhard, we're going to talk alittle bit about urban combat. And I wanted to just start this off bysaying a lot of people when they hear about urban combat, they think ofthat Blackhawk down scenario, Mogadishu and the problems that can gowrong here. This is not probably a comparable situation, is it? LT. COL. ROBERT LEONHARD, U.S. ARMY (RET.) : Not in any way. And one of the reasons is because we have armoredfighting vehicles there in Baghdad, and we will use them. Those tankshave 120-millimeter smoothbore gun on them. The Bradleys have25-millimetre chain guns and coaxial machine guns. That's a lot of mobileprotective gunfire. Completely different from the Mogadishu situation inwhich we did not have such vehicles. And we also are not going to usesimilar tactics there. We are much more likely to use patience andfinesse rather than assault tactics. O'BRIEN : All right. We want to show you an animation, and share with our viewers,maybe you can point out a few things about this. If we move in onBaghdad, and give you a sense of the kinds of targets that might beencountered in urban combat. What we've depicted here is something herewhich shows some armor sort of off the wings here, right over here is amosque. We depict that to show that's something you obviously want tostay clear as we just saw with the Ryan Chilcote piece from Najaf. As weget a little bit closer here, in a typical scenario like this, you mightvery well have Republican Guard snipers up on balconies like this, andpossibly up on the roofs of buildings and anti-aircraft artillery orartillery encampments like that. What we have presented her is an armoredcolumn with air support coming in. How much jeopardy is a column likethis in as it goes through these concrete canyons in a city? LEONHARD : It's a great question. I think the animation is good because it does showthat you can hide literally anywhere in a city environment, and that iswhy movement through an urban area is very, very dangerous. It's the sidethat's moving that's going to take the casualties. That said, the armoredfighting vehicles that you see there they look to me as if they're movinga little bit faster as than we probably will. We'll use patience andfinesse. We will take the time to locate the enemy, surround the blocksand the buildings that he is in. And then we'll probably surge fires intotheir both lethal and nonlethal to make his position untenable, to makehim move rather than us moving through the assault zone. At which time wecan engage them or arrest them. O'BRIEN : We'd like to resume with that animation if we could. That's SaddamInternational Airport. That's another segment. Can we get back to theanimation. And I'd like to just finish this out. Here we go. Ad we moveit along, you'll see eventually the troops will come marching in. In thiscase, slightly off target here because you see them all going in thefront door. Typically, when they'd assault a target like this, they'd dowhat? LEONHARD : Well, typically, if they do go in, which is generally the option of lastresort, but if we do have to go in, often we'll try to go in from the topof the building down. One of the reasons is because we use grenades a lotin clearing buildings, and grenades ten to offend downhill rather thanuphill. So, you always want them going down staircases rather than havingto try to throw them up the staircase. O'BRIEN : Interesting, all right. Gravity rules, even in urban combat. LieutenantColonel Robert Leonard, we appreciate your insights in urban combat,something that is not something that the U.S. military would prefer toengage in, but it might become inevitable. Thank you very much for yourtime. We appreciate it -- Judy. WOODRUFF : Thank you, Miles and thank you Colonel Leonhard. All of that certainlyhelps us visualize what might happen. President Bush vows a final push tovictory and he mourns the loss of fallen Marines. Up next, a report onthe president's trip to Camp Lejeune, and a look at how the Camp Lejeunecommunity is coping with the challenges of war.

===========Input: Iraq Warns of Unconventional Counter Attack Tonight; Saddam Sends 
Message Suggesting he is Alive, Still Defiant BLITZER : New explosions rock Baghdad after dark. Witnesses say they heard blastsaround a presidential complex in the center of the city. Meantime, theU.S. reportedly has hundreds of troops poised to reinforce the Baghdadinternational airport, now under the control of American troops. A sourcetells CNN's Nic Robertson, some Iraqi Republican Guard forces aregathering close to the airport. Columns of coalition forces keep pressingnorth and tightening the noose on Baghdad. CNN's Central Command sayssome 2,500 Republican Guard forces surrendered, that is, between Kut andBaghdad. Now, the latest on the fight for control of Baghdad'sInternational Airport. While coalition forces say they have secured thefacility, that's not the case in the surrounding area. ITN reporter JamesMates was with the U.S. forces when they moved in to secure the airport. JAMES MATES, ITN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : It was a showpiece of his regime. Now Saddam International Airport iscontrolled by coalition troops and, tonight, it has a new name, BaghdadInternational. These pictures were taken on the runway just moments afterthe coalition attack. A passenger jet burned out on the tarmac. Wreckageburning in a hangar as U.S. troops rush in. At dawn this morning, U.S.tanks and infantry had rolled in to claim their biggest prize of the warso far. Building by building, they swept the terminal complex, then movedon to secure the runway. The fall of his airport is a humiliating blowfor Saddam. It lies just 12 miles from Baghdad and will be a key forwardbase for U.S. troops as they prepare for a push on the capital. More than300 Iraqi soldiers have been left dead. Some Republican Guard troopsfought fiercely on the northern side of the airport complex. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Hopefully, this is a sign that we're able to send to the residents ofBaghdad that we're here and they can rise up and deal with the regimeappropriately. MATES : Outside the airport, the fighting was fierce, but the battle unequal.Here, the remains of an Iraqi armored car, and by its side the body of anIraqi soldier, all that remains of a column that pushed up the airportroad last night in a final effort to defend the airport. U.S. troops arenow knocking on the door of Baghdad. But the final push into the citycould yet prove to be the toughest fighting of all. (on camera): Thepatchy, somewhat disorganized defense of the airport last night has leftcoalition commanders with several questions. Have they done so muchdamage now to Iraqi command and control centers that they can no longerput up a proper fight, or are the best troops simply withdrawing into thecity, to fight there street by street? The answer to that could welldecide how quickly they make a final push into the city. James Mates, ITVNews, with the U.S. marines, south of Baghdad.

Message Suggesting he is Alive, Still Defiant BLITZER : Attacking on the ground and calling in air strikes, Kurdish fighters andU.S. troops have dislodged stubborn Iraqi soldiers at a key bridge innorthern Iraq. Iraqis pulled back on the road to Mosul as CNN's JaneArraf reports from the battlefield. JANE ARRAF, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : A few miles further to Mosul, Kurdish militia and their flags speeding toa town abandoned by Iraqi forces. After a day of fighting, the Iraqiswere driven back five kilometers, about three miles down the main roadwest towards Mosul from the Kurdish city of Erbil. Soldiers were Kurdish,but the special forces calling in air strikes on Iraqi positions wereAmerican. As U.S. warplanes dropped bombs near the town, Kurdish fightersmoved forward. (on camera): There's a slow-and-steady battle going onhere for control of the key bridge. It's a bridge over the river on themain road to Mosul. The Iraqis are firing artillery like that in responseto the Americans are calling in air strikes. The Peshmerga are just downthe road, and the Iraqis have retreated, but they're still holding on tothe bridge. (voice-over): That blast turned out to be a rocket-propelledgrenade, but there's plenty of artillery and mortar fire to come. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Are you coming here? ARRAF : Less than 20 minutes later, with Iraqi defenses pounded by the bombing,they no longer held the bridge over the Khoser River. In this vehicle,the only Iraqi casualties we saw. Their military radio and gunsindicating they were combatants. (on camera): It's still smoldering, thistruck with three Iraqi soldiers. It was either shelled or bombed. Now,it's a small part of this battle for the bridge just behind us. Thesewere lying on the ground next to the truck. Somebody picked them up. It'san I.D. card, presumably for one of the soldiers. The only thing you canreally tell from it is that he was 27 years old. And a snapshot from whenhis life was still ahead of him. Other evidence of a hurried retreat amidthe smoldering vehicles, a discarded gas mask. Military documents.Notebooks with verses from the Koran. Kurdish fighters planted their flagand left it waving in the smoke of the bombed-out Iraqi truck. Thevillage of Manguba (ph), just 32 kilometers, about 23 miles from Mosul isnow in Kurdish hands. One Kurdish soldier did the honors of tearing up aposter of Saddam Hussein. Not just the poster, but the frame andcardboard backing as well. They've been waiting a long time. Jane Arraf,CNN, on the bridge over the Khoser River in northern Iraq. BLITZER : Thanks very much. Judy, dangerous assignment for all of our reporters,our embedded journalists. And one of them, not from our CNN, but from avery close friend of all of ours, Michael Kelly, paid that price. Thefirst American embedded journalist to have gotten killed in covering thiswar. We'll have more on him at 5:00 on our special edition of "WOLFBLITZER REPORTS." Until then, thanks, Judy, back to you. WOODRUFF : Thanks, Wolf. And we'll be watching. Michael Kelly, of course, with"Atlantic Monthly," and a columnist for the "Washington Post." Well, atleast three U.S. service members were killed today in an apparent suicidebomb attack at a checkpoint near the Haditah Dam northwest of Baghdad.Those deaths are not yet included in the official casualty count. At lastreport, though, 41 Americans had been killed by hostile forces, 13 othersby friendly fire or in accidents. Of the 27 British troops, in all whohave been killed, at least 19 of them were said to be victims of friendlyfire or accidents. The official Iraqi casualty figures remain the samethis day, including more than 400 civilians killed, Iraqi authoritiessay. And U.S. Central Command says more than 4,000 Iraqis have beencaptured, but British officials believe that figure is much higher. Weknow that seven Americans are known to be held as prisoner of war inIraq. Another 15 Americans listed as missing in action. Well, funeralservices were held today in Colorado for 21-year- old Marine CorporalRandall Kent Rosacker. He was killed in action in Iraq. His story isespecially poignant. His father is a navy commander. He received word ofhis son's death within hours after the submarine that he was assigned toreturned home from an extended deployment. The Iraqis promise anunconventional attack on U.S. troops tonight. Do they mean guerillawarfare, as in Vietnam? We're going to ask our military analyst. That'scoming up.

===========Input: Coalition Troops Penetrate Outskirts of Baghdad WOODRUFF : Thanks, Wolf. And we will see you then. Well, as coalition forces pushahead in their bid to capture Baghdad, big questions remain about SaddamHussein and his whereabouts. It is still not clear, looking at the latesttapes of the Iraqi president, whether he's dead or alive. CNN seniorinternational correspondent Nic Robertson, who was expelled from Baghdad,is with us now from the border of Iraq and Jordan, on the Jordanian side,to talk about what's happening in the Iraqi capital. Nic, we're gettinginformation in bits and pieces about the incursion by coalition landforces, about air flights over the city. Help us pull it all together. NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT : Well, from what we hear from sources in Baghdad this evening, it had beenmostly quiet in terms of bombing throughout the day in Baghdad. Thenthere was a large explosion not far from the hotel journalists arestaying in in the center of Baghdad. Along the riverfront there, thereare a number of Ba'ath Party houses and buildings that appear to be --have some sort of military function. It's not clear exactly what thetarget was. What we're hearing from Iraqi people in the capital today isthat they know and they have seen coalition forces in the southwest ofthe city, in the southeast of the city. They say they have also seencoalition forces and believe coalition forces have a checkpoint on thenorthern outskirts of Baghdad as well. So as far as the Iraqi people areconcerned, they are very aware that coalition forces are right on theperimeter of the city. Our sources are also telling us that Iraqi forcesare massing artillery pieces and tanks at a number of locations on thesouthwestern edge of the city. These locations, actually, very close tothe center of Baghdad and appear to be forming something sort of frontline against the coalition forces. Now, Iraq's minister of informationtoday said that the coalition did not have control of the airport, thatthis was some sort of contrived video from the first day, and that, infact, hundreds of coalition soldiers had been killed, and their graveswere now at the airport. He did promise to take journalists to theairport, however, he never made -- he didn't make good on that promisethroughout the day. The information minister also read a statement fromPresident Saddam Hussein today, the Iraqi leader calling on people to beresolute, to be strong, and saying that if they put up a good fight, thenthe coalition would eventually back down. MOHAMMED SAEED AL-SAHAF, IRAQI INFORMATION MINISTER (through translator) : But to harm the enemy more and more, go against the enemy and destroy theenemy and follow the plans that you got in writing. God is great. May thecriminals lose. ROBERTSON : Now, representatives of the committee -- the International Committee forthe Red Cross, who have been to some of the hospitals in Baghdad, reporthigher-than-usual numbers of casualties coming into those hospitals. ROLAND NUGUENIN-BENJAMIN, INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS (on phone) : We had a chance in the morning to go to the main hospital, which iscalled Yarmuk (ph), and we found there has been a steady flow in ofhundreds of casualties, all over the night and through into the day,casualties -- I mean, war wounded had to be sent over, dispatched toother hospitals, because this Yarmuk was just totally overwhelmed by thesheer number of people coming in. ROBERTSON : Now, these Red Cross representatives say that most -- that two-thirds ofthe casualties they've seen in this particular hospital are, in fact,military casualties. And Iraqi officials promise to take journalists tothis particular hospital, the Yarmuk Hospital, that is now located, it'son the southwest of Baghdad, and it appears to be pretty much between theposition of where coalition forces have been seen and where Iraq now hasa militarized front-line position. Now, when journalists were taken tosee that hospital, twice they were turned around and told that theyweren't actually allowed to go inside that hospital, Judy. WOODRUFF : Nic, when you say Iraqis are seen now putting artillery pieces out andaround the city, are you saying out in the open, where they can -- wherethey are vulnerable, or are they making any attempt to hide them? Give usclearer picture of that. ROBERTSON : One of the areas where I understand they're locating tanks and artillerypieces is the Zawara (ph) Park. This is fairly central in Baghdad on theedge of a government area. It is a garden -- it is a large garden-typearea for people to take their children to go and play. It's -- there's asmall zoo there as well. It is, if you will, on the -- facing towards thesouthwestern area of the city. It faces off against the highway thatleads out to the airport. Now, that is not in a residential area. It is aclear, open area, apart from trees. The other areas that we understandwhere Iraqi officials are placing tanks and blocking off streets are inmore residential areas, Judy. WOODRUFF : All right. Nic Robertson, giving us a better understanding of exactlywhat the Iraqis are doing to prepare for any further moves by coalitionforces. Nic, thank you very much. Well, as American forces do push aheadtoward the Iraqi government's key center of power, British forces arekeeping up their work to the south of the Iraqi capital. ITN reporterJuliet Bremner is embedded with British forces in Iraq's second-largestcity, Basra, where the fight for control goes on.

===========Input: Coalition Troops Penetrate Outskirts of Baghdad JULIET BREMNER, ITV NEWS (voice-over) : Dominating the city gates to Basra. Saddam Hussein and his henchmen stillclaim to control this southern port. But the British want to send apowerful symbolic message. Soldiers are here to tear down the regime andall it stands for. By the time they leave Iraq, they're determined Saddamand his Ba'ath Party will have bitten the dust. The approach can seemfrustratingly slow, but day by day, the Desert Rats are exerting morecontrol. Checkpoints meant to filter out Iraqi hardliners. (on camera):They're well within striking distance of the mortars and rockets of theFedayeen militia, but they're prepared to take that risk to try andpersuade the people of Basra that they won't desert them, that they'llstick with this however messy it gets. (voice-over): Drastic action isneed to convince a dubious population. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Get down, get down! BREMNER : We watched a nighttime raid on the homes of Ba'ath Party officials andFedayeen militia. These are men singled out by locals and believed byarmy intelligence to be behind much of the brutality and corruption. Mostare not accused of specific crimes but suspected of being part of thestate-sponsored climate of fear. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : (UNINTELLIGIBLE), get up! BREMNER : The party's influence extends to every corner of Iraqi society. In twosmall communities, we witnessed more than 70 people being rounded up.Some are clearly terrified of what lies ahead, uncertain of their fate,overcome by nerves. But as it ended, there was no British apology for thescale of the operation. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : We came in firm, we came in fair. There was no shots fired. We gave agood warning before we came in. We've been playing warnings to people tostay in their houses, and we've only lifted those people we've got verygood intelligence on. BREMNER : This is not a tactic that can be regularly repeated, or the British riskbeing accused of installing their own rule of terror. Despite thediscomfort of a few, there's a conviction that this is a night's workthat will benefit the majority. Juliet Bremner in Basra. WOODRUFF : Well, there has been a terrible discovery by some other British troops insouthern Iraq. Up next, evidence at a makeshift morgue points to massexecutions by the Iraqi regime. But first, more scenes from today'sfighting in Baghdad.

===========Input: Coalition Troops Penetrate Outskirts of Baghdad WOODRUFF : Well, U.S. forces entering Baghdad do face the prospect of urban combat,a type of battle they have trained for, but, of course, they would preferto avoid. For more now on the unique challenges posed by urban combat,let's go back to Atlanta and join the man whose voice we just heard,Miles O'Brien. Hello again, Miles. O'BRIEN : Hello again, Judy. I'm joined by J. Kelly McCann, our security analyst, aman who's spent a lot of time learning about urban combat. You know, justthose two words together, I think, scare a lot of people because of allthe things that can go wrong. You know, I'm impressed, looking at thismap, it almost looks like a chess game, kind of sterile. That is --couldn't be further from the truth, could it? J. KELLY MCCANN, CNN SECURITY ANALYST : Absolutely not. This is very clean and it's very orderly. Suddenly whenwe show the videotape and we start to go there, you'll see just howconflicted an environment that is. O'BRIEN : And all happening so quickly. MCCANN : (UNINTELLIGIBLE). O'BRIEN : Let's roll some tape. We're going to kind of play it and stop it, andKelly's going to walk us through, I guess, Urban Combat 101. What are weseeing here? MCCANN : Just there, I mean, just getting the door out of the way, you can seewhere the weapons have to go. Now, you just see this soldier right here,he's going to his sidearm to make a little bit more mobile. And he's gotto be careful of his muzzle pointing at his partner right here. Now, he'sgoing to go that direction, because that room is clear. Go ahead and stopthe tape.As you make every entry, Miles, there are two dead spots, one,of course, in this direction right here, which you can't see from thedoorway, the other in this direction right here, and that's always theproblem, because as you come in here, you've got to be able to get inthere quickly and make sure that this person here doesn't get shot in theback. So... O'BRIEN : All right. Now, what about this, this armor? Tell us how they're equippedwith armor there. MCCANN : Level 4 armor, this is not just for frag. This will also stop bullets.And there's a difference. The normal flak jacket will stop fragments fromgrenades, et cetera. This is a plate that will actually stop and deform abullet. O'BRIEN : All right. Let's roll tape and continue on here and talk about -- Now, Inotice his hand -- his sidearm is attached to him. That's for... MCCANN : Exactly... O'BRIEN : ... (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... MCCANN : ... (UNINTELLIGIBLE) retention, for retention capability. So he goes downthe hallway, and you can see once that's called clear, straight triggerfinger, in case there's any sympathetic muscle tightening, there's noproblem. You'll see another person come right up here, and he'll hold onthis door, because that's not been cleared space yet, again, straighttrigger finger, but ready to shoot if he needs to. O'BRIEN : Sort of ready but not quite (UNINTELLIGIBLE). MCCANN : Absolutely. O'BRIEN : (UNINTELLIGIBLE). MCCANN : Immediately making entry with the thing, and then pying (ph) the roomout, getting angles of vision as they clear it. But look at that, a darkspace from a lighted space. Who knows what's in the recesses? O'BRIEN : All right. Let's roll that second tape quickly, and we'll show you acouple more tips from Kelly's perspective. So far, what we're seeing ispretty much textbook. MCCANN : Absolutely. (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... O'BRIEN : All right. Now, this is a rural setting, but this could be applied tourban combat, yes. MCCANN : Very different circumstance. Same thing when you come into a building.But stop the tape right here... O'BRIEN : Oop, we missed it, we missed it... MCCANN : ... if you would, (UNINTELLIGIBLE) -- It's all right. You can see allthis area... O'BRIEN : No, just roll it. MCCANN : ... out here. Just go ahead and roll it. All of that has to be accountedfor as well, not just the space in here. Your back is not covered. Manyangles you've got to watch for. Now, you see right here, he's got asidearm, he's calling the team in. All the rear is -- Now, stop the tape. O'BRIEN : Yes, (UNINTELLIGIBLE). MCCANN : Imagine a person that is concealed anywhere in here. I mean, you couldhave anyone with a rifle back in these areas here... O'BRIEN : Up in this area here, here... MCCANN : ... in any of these recesses back over here. O'BRIEN : Oop. MCCANN : I mean, you know, you're looking at -- he wouldn't have a bomb(UNINTELLIGIBLE)... O'BRIEN : No, he wouldn't have that. But let me ask you this. Also that the garb,(UNINTELLIGIBLE) there's a cultural issue here. That provides a lot ofcover for weapons if need be, right? MCCANN : Absolutely. And someones might say, Well, why put their hands on theirhead like this? Because, you know, you -- the hands hurt. And I won't beable to determine what you're doing with your face. Where are your handsand what do they hold? O'BRIEN : All right. Let's roll it real quickly and we'll make a few more points,if we could. A lot of fear in their faces here. You see, by the way, theyall have radios, I notice they have, like, a little headset there. Thatallows them to communicate (UNINTELLIGIBLE)... MCCANN : Immediate communications, absolutely. You see them having their sectorsof fire. All these areas up in here, you know, could be subjected topeople hiding, et cetera. Now you've got people coming down that havealready been cleared. Look at the fear on the faces. They don'tunderstand what's going on. O'BRIEN : And you want to keep them calm, and... MCCANN : Very calm, reassure them that this isn't about them. O'BRIEN : Wow. MCCANN : Now, here's a little bit more aggressive stance. Exactly. Go ahead andstop tape... O'BRIEN : Stop it right there. Oh, we missed it again. MCCANN : ... if you can. Obviously, that person is doing something that thatsoldier didn't appreciate. O'BRIEN : I would say aggressive is a good word for that... MCCANN : Absolutely. O'BRIEN : ... the business end of that M-16. All right, Kelly McCann, thank you forsome insights. And that -- compound that by a city of 5 million, it kindof boggles the mind and really gives you a sense of what lies head forU.S. and coalition forces. Thanks very much for your insights. MCCANN : Pleasure, Miles. O'BRIEN : Judy. WOODRUFF : Thanks, Miles and Kelly. I've always wondered what happened -- who coversthe last man or woman in one of those operations, but that's somethingfor your next conversation.

===========Input: Coalition Troops Penetrate Outskirts of Baghdad WOODRUFF : Thanks very much. An investigation is under way at a makeshift morgue insouthern Iraq after a gruesome discovery by some British troops. TimEwart of ITN News reports on evidence of atrocities at an abandoned Iraqimilitary base. TIM EWART, ITV NEWS (voice-over) : It was a discovery that horrified the soldiers who made it. The remainsof hundreds of men were found in plastic bags and Unsealed hard-boardcoffins. British troops found the bodies at an abandoned Iraqi militarybase on the outskirts of Azubayr. The evidence suggested it was the sceneof appalling atrocities. The teeth in many of the skulls had been broken,and bones appeared to be wrapped in strips of military uniform. It's notclear how long the bodies had lain here, but they were clearly not fromthis war. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : You come to expect everything in war fighting. The coffins were there. Itwas a bit more of a surprise when I discovered the bags with the humanremains inside. EWART : Inside a neighboring building, there was evidence of cells and a catalogof photographs of the dead. Most had died from gunshot wounds to thehead. Others were mutilated beyond recognition, their faces burned andswollen. Outside, soldiers discovered what they described as a purpose-built shooting gallery, the brickwork behind it riddled with bullets.Identity cards revealed the names of some of the dead. Forensicspecialists will now visit the scene and hope to establish the truth ofwhat happened here and when. (on camera): Today's discovery seems toprovide shocking evidence of atrocities under Saddam Hussein's regime.Most people are afraid to talk openly about what's been happening here.But when they do, British soldiers believe, more horrors will come tolight. Tim Ewart, ITV News, Azubayr. WOODRUFF : Well, from a gruesome finding to a dangerous one in central Iraq. U.S.troops work to clear that area of Iraqi weapons, coming up.

===========Input: Coalition Troops Penetrate Outskirts of Baghdad WOODRUFF : We've been hearing about the situation in northern and southern Iraq. Nowto central Iraq, where coalition forces say they are now in charge. Andthey are coming across some major munitions finds. The caches wereapparently abandoned by retreating Iraqi forces. One such cache turned upin the city of Karbala, a strategic military point about 60 miles to thesouth of Baghdad. CNN's Ryan Chilcote is embedded with the 101st AirborneDivision, and he has the story. RYAN CHILCOTE, CNN CORRESPONDENT : Can you show us what you've been finding today? SGT. 1ST CLASS LARRY CLARK, U.S. ARMY : Roger. Well, this is about the third cache we've found today. We've beenfinding them nonstop, and it's a really tedious affair. I've got anassortment of weapons right here, ranging from AK-47s, to over here,behind them, you'll see mortar sights, 60-millimeter and 81. Off on thefar left, you'll see a second-generation starscope, kind of outdated, butstill works. If you keep shifting over, you'll see stabilizer fins formortar rounds. On the back here, you'll see both 60- and 82-millimetermortars. CHILCOTE : These are well equipped. CLARK : Well, they're very well equipped. Definitely put up a fight.Rocket-propelled grenades. Been finding a lot of these lately. Thesecould take out a Jeep or a Humvee in a heartbeat. CHILCOTE : Now, is this a -- you said you'd seen a lot of weapons caches recentlyfound. CLARK : (UNINTELLIGIBLE). CHILCOTE : Is this a large cache? CLARK : No, I'd say this is about a medium cache. What... CHILCOTE : This looks like a lot of weapons. CLARK : It looks like a lot of weapons, but it's really not. This -- technically,this would probably would outfit a platoon, a platoon of(UNINTELLIGIBLE). CHILCOTE : OK. CLARK : Keep going on. This is a little bit more advanced, these are25-millimeter shells, and each one of those silver boxes you see behindthem hold 50 of these shells. That's a little bit above us. That'sactually going into mechanized and armor. CHILCOTE : All right. And you were talking about the makers, where some of theseweapons are coming from, and you were expressing surprise to me. CLARK : Roger. A majority of these are coming from -- (UNINTELLIGIBLE) on thisbox, but Jordan and France. We have a very scattered, limited, andRussian equipment, but like I said, France and Jordan are the mainsuppliers right here. CHILCOTE : Now for your guys, this is dangerous work, finding... CLARK : It's -- yes, it's extremely dangerous, because once you enter thesebuildings, we found, actually, enemy, you know, guarding these sites.Don't know if they're going to be booby trapped. Don't know what --what's going to be there. So it's very tedious, it's -- got to be carefulabout it. WOODRUFF : Well, we've heard a whole lot about Iraq's use of human shields indefending key sites. Coalition fighters, though, use a different kind ofshield. In a CNN exclusive, CNN's Kyra Phillips offers us a ride-alongover the city of Baghdad with some airborne bodyguards. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : We won't consider the mission a success unless the Marines are happy withthe product. KYRA PHILLIPS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : They are coalition bodyguards over Baghdad, an airborne shield to U.S.Marines. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Let them know what's coming. Let them know if anything is coming backbehind them on their franks to close off the supply lines. PHILLIPS : You're now airborne over Iraq with Commander Steve Kroto's (ph) GrayKnights, the Navy's P-3 eyes in the sky. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Any kind of forces that look like they may be threatening the Marines,you know, we want to let them know. And we have the capability to sendpictures or actual video, and then they can make (UNINTELLIGIBLE) if theywant to maybe avoid that area or go ahead and go out and engage thosefolks. PHILLIPS : Dodging missiles and triple-A fire is something new to this squadron.However, protecting forces on the ground isn't. (on camera): These menare about three hours into their mission, and the sun is starting to set.They've just come across one of the Marine convoys that they need totrack, so they're watching every move that the Marines make as they movetowards Baghdad, making sure they don't come across any type of threat. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : We're getting closer to it. PHILLIPS (voice-over) : Also on this mission, Marine Colonel Jim Lukeman (ph) and Sergeant EmilioHernandez. They are tracking and talking to their fellow Marines on theground... UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Two vehicles move across the bridge... PHILLIPS : ... making sure they don't get ambushed. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I'm looking for enemy positions out to the front. We'll look at theroutes ahead of where our guys are going to go and try to see what enemyis there. PHILLIPS : Lukeman is warning his troops about a bridge ahead. He doesn't like whathe sees. The Gray Knights fly closer and grab a clearer picture. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : There's some vehicular traffic, so that we know the bridge is stillintact. They may be Iraqi military. So now that the Marine division onthe ground has that information, they'll take that action -- they'll takeaction tactically on it. PHILLIPS : These flights can last up to 15 hours, but it's the minutes of realtimeintelligence that completes the mission. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : When you're on the ground fighting, every piece of information you've gotabout what you're coming up against is golden. PHILLIPS : Commander Steve Kroto brings his crew home after locating enemy positionsand surface-to-surface missiles. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : It keeps the Marines safe. And one more safe Marine is one more Marinethat can continue on north to Baghdad. PHILLIPS : Flying over Iraq, Kyra Phillips, CNN. WOODRUFF : Coming up, we are going to go live to Fort Bliss, where the name of thatbase is a far cry from the mood there today, after confirmation that moreof their own were killed on the battlefield.

===========Input: War in Iraq WOODRUFF : An apparent friendly fire incident in northern Iraq is taking more of atoll on Kurdish leaders than we knew at first. Eighteen people are nowreported dead. And there are late reports that the 45 wounded include thebrother and a son of a Kurdish political leader. Julian Manyon of ITN hasmore from Northern Iraq. JULIAN MANYON, ITN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : It is another friendly fire disaster. This morning, an American bombdestroyed a convoy carrying high officials of the Kurdish Peshmergaforces, which have been fighting alongside the Americans on the northernfront. At least 17 Kurdish commanders and their guards were killed, alongwith an interpreter working for the BBC. More than 40 were injured. Themilitary chief of the Kurdish KDP, the brother of their leader, MassudBarzani (ph), was gravely hurt. (on camera): Trying to organize anorthern front with just a few hundred U.S. Special Forces troops and thepoorly armed Kurdish Peshmerga guerrillas was always going to be ahigh-risk exercise. The idea was to open the way with heavy sustainedAmerican bombing of Iraqi positions. But today, it all went disastrouslywrong. (voice-over): Even as we filmed the wreckage, U.S. jets were stilldropping their bombs nearby. Giant explosions erupted down the road.Earlier, we had joined another convoy of U.S. Special Forces troops andKurdish fighters as they tried to move south through country abandoned bythe Iraqi army. At first, all was calm. American troops controlled theoperation from a rooftop. Then, as the Kurds advanced again, the Iraqisopened up. (on camera): Now we're hearing the boom of Iraqi guns as theyfire towards our positions. All morning, the Kurds have been trying toadvance, and that was the shell going off. (voice-over): The Iraqigunners rapidly found our range, and we took refuge in an abandoned farmhouse. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Get down. Get down! MANYON : We finally managed to get out by car. Here in the north, Iraqi tanks andguns are still firing, and the American effort is looking a littleragged. Julian Manyon, ITV News, on the northern front. WOODRUFF : Julian Manyon with some very dramatic pictures as we look at the livepictures of Baghdad at night. We will take a short break, our livecoverage continues.

But it is being rediscovered by U.S. troops inIraq, at least some of them. Karl Penhaul is with an Army attackhelicopter battalion in the town of Najaf in southeastern Iraq. KARL PENHAUL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : War, soldiers say, is long hours of boredom, followed by a few moments ofmadness. Away from the thick of the action, soldiers' minds turn tofamily, friends and lovers. No phones, no e-mail, letters are the onlylink to home. Melony Marshall was married just a month before she leftfor Iraq. PFC MELONY MARSHALL, U.S. ARMY : "Hi, sweetheart. How you doing? I haven't received mail in two days.Being out here in the heat, it is so exhausting. My love for you growsstronger every day. The tent, I have to come home to seven people that,they are not so bad half the time. But, sometimes, you need time awayfrom people. I miss you more and more. I'm ready to come home. When I gethome, I don't want to see a camera. I don't want to see a band. I don'twant to see a formation. I just want to come home." PENHAUL : Attack pilot John Davis is feeling sad he's missing seeing his childrengrow up. CWO JOHN DAVIS, U.S. ARMY : "Dear Keegan (ph), Britney (ph) and Josh (ph), I'm doing fine, as is therest of the battalion. I really miss you guys a lot. And I can hardlywait for the day I can be with you again. In hindsight, I look back andsee plenty of opportunities which I could have used to be a betterfather, but yet let slip by. It's unfortunate that it's taken yet anotherseparation from you for me to realize this. Perhaps I can do better whenI get home." PENHAUL : Tiffany O'Neal, a military cook, vents her frustration about the rigorsof desert warfare to a friend. PFC TIFFANY O'NEAL, U.S. ARMY : "Hey, Ashley (ph), how you doing? Me, I'm hot as hell out here. For thelast two nights, we woke up to put our gas masks on for no reason. Ourlittle section gets the information last, or the best we can get. I guessnobody cared enough to inform the cooks." PENHAUL : In his previous letter home, Apache pilot Joe Bruhl didn't tell hisfamily the full details about his first combat mission. Now he's tryingto set the record straight. 1ST LT. JOE BRUHL, U.S. ARMY : "In my previous letter, written less than two days removed, I only wantedto convey my safety. We did receive heavy fire and many of our aircrafttook significant hits, including mine. I tell you all this not to worryyou, but to give you comfort knowing what you hear and see is true andthat, despite that, I am safe and will continue to be. PENHAUL (on camera) : Different ranks, different anxieties, but all are hoping, by the timetheir letters get back to the U.S., they too will soon be heading home.Karl Penhaul, for CNN, An Najaf, Iraq. WOODRUFF : Very poignant. And I bet that father is a better father than he giveshimself credit for being. That's it for this special edition of INSIDEPOLITICS. I'm Judy Woodruff.

===========Input: null WOODRUFF : And, as we listened to John King's report, we can tell you that PresidentBush has just -- his plane has just landed at Andrews Air Force Base,just close to the Washington area, the president having flown back to theUnited States from that meeting in Northern Ireland in Belfast with theBritish prime minister, Tony Blair. You just heard John reporting aboutit. They primarily talked about the war in Iraq, the aftermath of Iraq.But they also discussed the Middle East and, as well, getting theNorthern Ireland peace process started up again. It has been said thatSaddam Hussein ruled Iraq with an iron fist. I guess you can say in thepast tense. His regime has left behind some disturbing evidence tosupport those claims. The abandoned secret police headquarters in Basrais just one example. ITN's Bill Neely is with the Royal Marines and hetakes us on a tour of Basra's chamber of horrors. BILL NEELY, ITN REPORTER (voice-over) : Saddam Hussein's Iraq is a state of terror, and this is where it'splanned and perpetrated, the headquarters of his secret police, this onein Basra. No British soldier has been here yet. Today, as I walked in, Imet Iraqis, none of whom had ever been inside willingly. What was tofollow was a horrific education in terror and torture: in the smokingbasement of the bombed building, a warren of cells. Here, prisoners weretortured. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Yes, of course. NEELY : People died. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : People died, people in prison without court, without trial. NEELY : Any people who Saddam did not like. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Of course. Of course. NEELY (voice-over) : The building is crumbling. Down we went, further to cells that had nolight, little air, cockroaches, filth, and, on the ground, a gas mask andbottles of chemicals. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : You can imagine this every day, every month. So many people come here,but we don't know about them at all. NEELY : These ordinary Iraqis had been terrified to come here, until today,though one student on the left had been here before. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : He was one of the prisoners here. (on camera): For how long? UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Eight years. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Eight, nine, eight years. NEELY (voice-over) : And his crime for eight years in jail? He prayed too much and was seen asa dangerous radical. (on camera): More cells. (voice-over): But theMukhabarat headquarters had more horrors to reveal. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : And they tied their hands behind and hung them and hung them for manydays. NEELY : These men had relatives murdered here. So desperate are they to telltheir story that they began reenacting what they and their brothers andfriends have suffered. The hook in the ceiling is for one purpose only,another hook in a different cell and a different form of torture. SaddamHussein controlled Iraq through fear, torture and execution. And ithappened here to tens of thousands of Iraqis that Saddam's secret policedeemed dangerous. This man cowered for months, crammed with 300 mothersinto a huge cell. Hamid Fatil (ph) may look like he's acting, but he wastortured here, along with his two brothers, who were executed. This manwas here, too, with his brother. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : They sentenced him to death. And they sent him to Baghdad and killed. Hewas hanged there, hanged. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : There's a prisoner under the name of Ahmed Adis Aeid (ph). NEELY : They kept records of prisoners, these and their fingerprints all that'sleft of them, apart from the photographs they took of exactly what theyhad done. (on camera): If there is an evil center to Saddam Hussein'sregime, then it is surely here and in other places of torture. Andthere's plenty here that we simply cannot show you. In this block, it wasmen over here, hundreds of them, and women and children here.(voice-over): To call all this a chamber of horrors is a cliche. And thisplace is beyond cliche. The hundreds or thousands who died here who weregiven no trial, no voice, cry out. On the ground, I found a book called"The Psychology of Interrogation," as if the men who worked here forSaddam needed a handbook. I was glad of the fresh air and glad to leave,glad I could. No one knows yet whether the new Iraq will be the kind ofplace where these children can grow up free of the fear, the horror oftorture. Bill Neely, ITV News, Basra. WOODRUFF : Unspeakable. Journalists killed in the line of duty in Baghdad -- howneutral are reporters in a war supposed to be? Our Jeff Greenfieldexamines that question when we come back.

===========Input: null WOODRUFF : Well, the journalists' death raise questions about the tactics of U.S.troops trying to take control of Baghdad. They also serve as a reminderthat many of our colleagues covering this war are putting their lives onthe line every day. Some thoughts now on the dangers from our senioranalyst, Jeff Greenfield. JEFF GREENFIELD, CNN SR. ANALYST (voice-over) : When an Al- Jazeera reporter was killed today, the network charged it hadbeen targeted by U.S. force. Central Command said, no, its forces weretrading fire from a hotel where the network was housed. At a nearbyhotel, two other journalists, a photographer from Reuters and anotherfrom Tele 5 Spain died, another case, CENTCOM says, of coalition forcesreturning fire. A Kurdish journalist died in a U.S. friendly-fireaccident in the north. And an American writer/editor, "Washington Post"editorial columnist Michael Kelly, was killed when his Humvee plungedinto a canal while evading Iraqi fire. (on camera): It is an elementaryfact of life during wartime: A press pass provides no protection.(voice-over): Famed World War II reporter Ernie Pyle was killed by asniper on an island in the Pacific. Famed combat photographer RobertCapa, who took a classic photo of a fighter's death during the SpanishCivil War, himself died from a land mine in Indochina. Sean Flynn, son ofthe famous actor Errol Flynn, disappeared in Cambodia in 1970. More than65 journalists of many nationalities died in Southeast Asia. ABC Newsproducer David Kaplan was killed by sniper fire in the Balkans in 1992.Sometimes reporters, like "The Wall Street Journal"'s Danny Pearl, die incovering a different kind of war. Pearl was murdered by terrorists inPakistan. The casualty count helps put the ongoing debate aboutjournalistic neutrality into a sharper light. The 600 journalistsembedded with American troops in Iraq will be threatened by the same fireas the troops they are covering. Their safety, their lives, may depend onthose troops. Neutrality in a firefight? Not likely. And that raises abigger question. Are they supposed to be neutral on the outcome of thewar? In an interview with broadcasting and cable magazine, CBS NewsPresident Andrew Heyward said of the neutrality notion -- quote -- "It'sone of the stupidest things I've ever heard. This story is going to betold from a U.S. point of view. We are American reporters, the ones withthe troops." (on camera): Now, none of this means journalists will ignoreunsettling news: military setbacks, lack of supplies, the infliction ofcivilian casualties. Reporters who ignore or distort facts are betrayingtheir craft no matter what and no matter how much that may anger thepeople running a war. But whether in the old Soviet Union or Nazi Germanyor South Africa or Iraq, respect for the facts does not require areporter to throw his values over the side. Jeff Greenfield, CNN, NewYork. WOODRUFF : And tonight on "LARRY KING LIVE," Al-Jazeera correspondent Omar Al Issawiwill talk to Larry about the death of his colleague and the continuingplight of journalists in a war zone.

===========Input: U.S. Forces Hunt for Last of Saddam's Loyal Fighters WOODRUFF : You are looking at live pictures of the White House where President Bushwatched some of the television coverage of events in Baghdad today.Separately, Vice President Cheney shared his thoughts in a speech in NewOrleans. With me now for more on all this, CNN's senior White Housecorrespondent John King. John, they have to be happy there. JOHN KING, CNN SNR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT : Judy, they are. Behind the scenes privately here you get a palpable senseof vindication, although publicly caution is the watchword here,administration officials from the vice president on down saying the waris not over yet. Some of the toughest fighting could still be ahead.Mostly they believe in those northern Iraq areas Brent Sadler was justtalking about before the break. But they do believe the pictures out ofBaghdad today, on the one hand, send as powerful a message as you cansend to the people in the Arab world who have criticized this war. Peoplein Baghdad celebrating. U.S. troops assisting in pulling down that statueof Saddam Hussein. Across the Arab world, the administration hopes tosend a signal that the United States is there to help the Iraqi peopleregain control of their own country, as a liberty, not as any imperial oroccupying force. Of course, at the same time, though, the White Houseworries that the American people might see these pictures and think thewar is over. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney amongthose saying the toughest fighting might still lie ahead, stillunanswered questions about the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein and otherkey members of the Iraqi leadership. The vice president made thatargument today. But even as he sounds that note of caution, you do sensea little tiny bit of we told you so. DICK CHENEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : Bottom line, with less than half of the ground forces and two-thirds ofthe air assets used 12 years ago in Desert Storm, Secretary Rumsfeld andGeneral Franks have achieved a far more difficult objective. Yet untilthis war is fully won, we cannot be overconfident in our position. And wemust not underestimate the desperation of whatever forces remain loyal tothe dictator. KING : We will not hear from the president today, we are told, but before theweek is out and perhaps as early as tomorrow officials say the presidentis likely to offer his thoughts on the challenges just ahead. So, again,behind the scenes, a sense of vindication, but also a cautious attitudebecause of the fighting still to come. I have to tell you, though, Judy,the CIA Director George Tenet walked out of the White House a short timeago with a giant smile on his face. I cannot recall a moment sinceSeptember 11, 2001 and those tragic events when we have seen the CIAdirector look so happy. WOODRUFF : Well, John, given all that you've said, we know that there's an Americanretired general waiting in Kuwait. But in addition to that, what stepsare they already taking at the White House to plan for a post-SaddamHussein government in Iraq? KING : They are planning to accelerate that planning process. Jay Garner theretired general will go into Iraq soon with his troops soon. I saytroops. They are civilians from the U.S. government. That will take placesoon. They are awaiting for word from the Pentagon that it believes thesecurity environment is secure enough for that to happen. And beginningas early as next week, there will be a series of town meetings, if youwill. The invitations will be issued by General Tommy Franks. They aretrying to identify Iraqis from within the country, as well as Iraqidissidents and exiles, the diaspora they call it here at the White House,who will be part of a planning process to begin the process -- they sayit could takes weeks or more -- of selecting who should be part of thatinterim Iraqi authority. Now, we know, one person who will be invited isplanning process, those planning meetings, is Ahmed Chalabi. He is theleader of the Iraqi National Congress. He is known to be a favorite ofVice President Dick Cheney, of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and SecretaryRumsfeld's top deputy, Paul Wolfowitz. He will be involved in theplanning and in those meetings. But I also should report that there is asense of annoyance here at the White House, even among some of Mr.Chalabi's top supporters, that, since returning to Iraq in recent days,he has complained frequently, including on our air earlier today, thatthe United States is moving too slowly to get in the reconstructionefforts, to restore electricity and restore water. Over at the Pentagontoday, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, again, a supporter of Mr. Chalabi,said that, in his view, services were already at their prewar levels. AndMr. Rumsfeld went on to say, Secretary Rumsfeld went on to say, there isstill a war going on, still quite a dangerous situation -- Judy. WOODRUFF : Yes, we caught some of that irritation in his choice. All right, JohnKing, our senior White House correspondent, thank you. Still to come:warfare amid the celebrations in Baghdad. As Iraqis poured into thestreets to mark their apparent new freedom, American troops come underfire from a different area. CNN's Martin Savidge will show us what theycame up against at Baghdad University.

And one group of sailors isgetting letters from elementary school children in North Carolina. Thestudents are getting inspiration from their teacher, who has a personalconnection, as CNN's Daryn Kagan reports. DARYN KAGAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : It started as a story on port security, how U.S. Navy and Coast Guardreserves are keeping ships safe from attack in Kuwait and Iraq. (oncamera): The mission of these units is to protect these ports.(voice-over): But among the boats, guns, radar, sonar and communications,we found a secret weapon posted on the side of the tent that serves asthe command center: letters from second-graders. Each one starts the sameway. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : "Dear brave friend." UNIDENTIFIED MALE : "Dear brave friend." LT. CMDR. MIKE ROBERTS, U.S. NAVY : "Dear brave friend. Hello. My name is Ryan. I am in second grade. You arekeeping the United States of America safe. You are..." UNIDENTIFIED MALE : "You are my best friend. You can keep this in your bag. Sincerely, Ryan." ROBERTS : I'm the big brother. KAGAN : It turns out this is actually a story about a brother, LieutenantCommander Mike Roberts, and a supportive sister, Christine Cupolo. CHRISTINE CUPOLO, TEACHER : Yes, I do. My brother is in Kuwait. ROBERTS : My sister is a grammar school teacher in Clayton, North Carolina. CUPOLO : He was sent over right next to the Persian Gulf now since New Year's Eve.And this is one of many deployments he's been on, but this one isprobably the most crucial. ROBERTS : Her second-graders were very interested in sending some letters out tothe troops. CUPOLO : So, I knew that, at one point or another, my children needed to write. Ithought that would be a real uplifting experience for the troops. ROBERTS : And she says: "Dear brave friend. Hello. My name is Amanda." UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : "We would have to say that you are a very brave person. When the warstarts, your heart will be in our souls." ROBERTS : For these kids to takes time to read letters to us and stuff like that intheir class, what more can you ask? Just keep it going. KAGAN : There will be more letters on the way. Back in North Carolina, theRiverwood Elementary second-graders are working on the next batch. CUPOLO : Absolutely. You might want to mention that in your letter as well. KAGAN : This time, they hope the sailors will write back with answers to theirquestions. CUPOLO : So you want to know how fast the dolphins there are swimming? OK. I wouldwrite that down. I would say: "Dear, friend, I have some questions foryou. I want to know about the dolphins that are helping you out overthere." Can you do that? Do you think you could ask them a question?Sure. They will be happy to answer it. We started work on our letters thelast week of February and worked on them the first week of March and sentthem out a few weeks ago. And they got the letters pretty quickly overthere. But I think this helps me stay closer to my brother. KAGAN (on camera) : Any message to your sister? ROBERTS : Yes. I'd just like to tell her, thank you very much, Christine. Hopeyou're doing well in North Carolina. And thank you very much to yourstudents for all the support and the letters that they sent out to us. KAGAN (voice-over) : Their second-grade work keeping watch over those who keep watch in thePersian Gulf. Daryn Kagan, CNN, Kuwait.  WOODRUFF : Those letters important at both ends.

===========Input: Saddam Hussein is Losing Grip on Northern Cities in Iraq WOODRUFF : Yesterday, there were scenes of jubilation in Baghdad, today, a suicidebombing and firefighters, grim reminders that, as U.S. Central Commandput it, Baghdad is still an ugly place. CNN's John Irvine has thisprofile of a city literally teetering on a razor's edge. JOHN IRVINE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : Getting acquainted, very deliberately, the U.S. Marines are trying tostrike up a rapport with the people who are now their responsibility. Butthere are still problems bringing control to Baghdad, particularly atnighttime. In the pitch black of a city without power, these soldiersmanning a roadblock became nervous. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Stay the (EXPLETIVE DELETED) back! Back up! IRVINE : When a car fails to stop, it's the cue for a violent gun battle. Bulletsare sprayed everywhere. In parts of Baghdad that the Americans haven'tyet reached, there has been looting. This man took the horse from astable at the home of Uday Hussein, Saddam's eldest son. We found thehouse, a large, gaudy structure, a place that just a few days ago peopledidn't even look at for fear of their lives. This indeed was one ofUday's homes. Here, the ruling family could look out over the Tigris.People have wasted no time clearing the house and wrecking what couldn'tbe easily taken. (on camera): They haven't quite worked out just how toreach this will chandelier yet. But, other than that, they have strippedthis place bare in less than 24 hours. Call it plunder, if you will, orperhaps payback. (voice-over): These Iraqis were rifling a home of asenior member of the Mukhabarat, Saddam's dreaded secret police. It alsoseemed to be some kind of monitoring station. There was sophisticatedequipment here. In the basement, we found burning archives and evidenceof electronic surveillance. This had been a nerve center for spying, aplace from where the bully boys kept tabs to keep control. (on camera):We're now in the bowels of a secret police monitoring station. Look atall this gadgetry, quite sinister really, part of the apparatus of BigBrother. (voice-over): These people are stealing from a shopping center.It has become widespread, but it's not being done with total impunity.These thieves are trying to flee the German Embassy, having been shot atby a guard.

===========Input: Saddam Hussein is Losing Grip on Northern Cities in Iraq WOODRUFF : Some pictures. Well, Laith Kubba is an Iraqi exile who has family membersin Iraq. Mr. Kubba is a senior fellow at a think tank called the NationalEndowment for Democracy. He is also the president of a group of Iraqiexiles, a group called the Iraq National Group. He joins us now fromLondon to talk about rebuilding his country. Mr. Kubba, first of all,your thoughts as you've watched these scenes of Baghdad, the SaddamHussein regime falling in the last day? LAITH KUBBA, PRESIDENT, IRAQI NATIONAL GROUP : It is a huge sigh of relief, because it could have been much worse andBaghdad could have been a war theater with more destruction to property.And, obviously, there are four million people who could have sufferedmore. So, there is a sigh of relief that it is not worse. But, obviously,there is a great, great concern about the scenes that you've been showingon television. WOODRUFF : Are you talking to family members now in Baghdad and around Iraq? And, ifyou are, how concerned are they about the lawlessness? KUBBA : Well, not in the recent three or four days. There are no phone lines toBaghdad. In other parts of Iraq, I received with great sadness thekilling of one close colleague, Saeed Abu Naji Abhuey (ph) in Najaf. Hewas not killed by former members of the Baath Party or the security ofthe army, but by just a local organized group. So those signs to me areworrying. People are sensing and feeling the lack of authority or thepower vacuum and are testing it. And the more they test, the more I thinkthey are claiming. WOODRUFF : How difficult will it be to sort out who will next hold power in Iraqafter this transition period, however long it is, where the U.S. is incharge? KUBBA : Well, one needs to break down this process into various elements. Today,there should be an authority. And it's very likely that the U.S. and theBritish forces are the authority on land. And there ought to beadministration. And this ought to be primarily by Iraqis. But when itcomes to government, I think we really need to map out step by step howto move from this power vacuum to the day we have elections. We need toinvolve the U.N. We need to involve all Iraqi forces in the country,outside the country. But we need to do it quickly, because every daypasses by with this vacuum, it's going to spell trouble. WOODRUFF : Well, we know, Mr. Kubba, there are several Iraqi exiles groups competingfor influence. Is one of them going to have an advantage? And,particularly, I have in mind the Iraqi National Congress that Mr.Chalabi, who was assisted by U.S. forces in getting back into Iraq? KUBBA : I think it's one thing to gain fame and access to Washington. It'stotally another to gain legitimacy and functioning grounds inside Iraq.And I think plans must not be drawn in thin air out in Washington. Itmust really be drawn on the ground inside Iraq. And there are 22 millionpeople there. It's not a void. It's not a vacuum. And I think all plansmust be anchored there in Iraq in its reality. WOODRUFF : So does one group have an advantage over another now? KUBBA : There are different groups who have advantage over others in differentparts of the country. Unfortunately, we do not have a national group thatcan appeal to Iraqis as Iraqis within a credible voice.This needs to beconstructed, maybe through a conference to be held in Baghdad, whererepresentatives from provinces all over Iraq need to participate, as wellas political groups. But we do not have a single group, a singleleadership or a single council yet. WOODRUFF : We're talking with Laith Kubba, who is the president of a group of Iraqiexiles. The group is called the Iraq National Group. Mr. Kubba, we thankyou so much for talking to us from London. KUBBA : Thank you. WOODRUFF : We appreciate it. KUBBA : Thank you. WOODRUFF : Here in Washington, members of the House of Representatives come togetherto support America's armed forces. Up next: a live report on thatceremony and the latest efforts to pass a spending bill to pay for thewar.

===========Input: Lynch Travels Back to U.S.; Is Life in Iraq Stabilizing?; Is Bush 
Administration Planning Other Regime Changes? WOODRUFF : A reminder, Jessica Lynch coming back to the United States within thehour. Tonight, a special on the rescue of Jessica Lynch. That's at 8:30p.m. Eastern, 5:30 Pacific. Well, after many trying months of defendingSaddam Hussein, Ambassador Mohammed Aldouri finally said the game isover. Now, his tenure at the United Nations is over, too. Last nightbefore leaving the United States, Aldouri said he hopes to see freeelections in a free Iraq. CNN's Richard Roth has more on this onceprominent frontman for the Iraqi regime. RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : The last time Iraqi's U.N. ambassador addressed the Security Council, theU.S. ambassador walked out in protest. MOHAMMED ALDOURI, IRAQI AMBASSADOR TO U.N. (through translator) : What happened is that the Iraqi army up until now has not confronted theUnited States forces. ROTH : But now, it's the Iraqi ambassador's time to leave, the United States. ALDOURI : The game is over. I hope that peace will prevail, and that the Iraqipeople at the end of the day will have a peaceful life. ROTH : Mohammed Aldouri spent more years as a university professor than as adiplomat. In New York, he briefed people interested in his country,recently a group of Lehigh University students. But he never gotcomfortable in the media glare before and especially during the war. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : You said you weren't... ALDOURI : (UNINTELLIGIBLE) has happened with you? Please, why did you come here? UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Because we thought... ALDOURI : Tomorrow, I will see you in the U.N. ROTH : And at the U.N., all ambassadors carry out their instructions whetherthey agree with them or not. JUAN GABRIEL VALDES, CHILEAN AMBASSADOR TO U.S. : Well, I think that he had a very, very difficult task. He defended thepositions of his country with courage, I would say. JEREMY GREENSTOCK, BRITISH AMBASSADOR TO U.N. : He's a decent man, and I hope he finds a decent life representing adecent government. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Aldouri is a dear friend of mine. ROTH : Aldouri also drew support from opponents of the war a gift of papercranes. But on the eve of Aldouri's departure, women representing theDaughters of the American Revolution passed by, wanting to let fly withsomething else. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : If I had eggs, I would like to throw eggs at him. ROTH : U.N. diplomats don't toss eggs, just nods. Several months ago, the U.S.ambassador, John Negroponte, and the Iraqi ambassador almost locked eyes.And forget about Kuwait. MOHAMMED ABULHASAN, KUWAITI AMBASSADOR TO U.N. : Nothing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Not one word? ABULHASAN : Not one word, except a normal greeting of, "Hello, how are you?" ROTH : That was as close as residents of New York's Upper East Side district gotto know Aldouri, who kept a low profile, like many in the big city. It'sa neighborhood you wouldn't expect the diplomatic post of an enemygovernment to turn up. ALDOURI : I am very thankful for the people of New York, for their generosity. Thisis a very decent people. I was really -- without talking about theproblem in Iraq, I was really happy to be here in New York, within thepeople of New York. ROTH : Aldouri was worried most about the people of Iraq. ALDOURI : When I see, what I've seen, what you see, my heart squeezes blood. ROTH : Aldouri was in better spirits as he departed for the airport with a finalmessage. ALDOURI : I hope that the United States Army will leave Iraq soon, and we will havefree election for a free government for a free future for Iraq and thepeople for Iraq. This is my message to you, to the people of the UnitedStates. ROTH : The ambassador's prime concern now: his family in Iraq. One day he hopesto teach again back home. Richard Roth, CNN, United Nations. WOODRUFF : We'll try to track his progress and see if he's able to do that,Ambassador Aldouri. Still ahead, looters cast about for new places toloot, and chaos is king in Baghdad. We'll have a report.

===========Input: Lynch Travels Back to U.S.; Is Life in Iraq Stabilizing?; Is Bush 
Administration Planning Other Regime Changes? WOODRUFF : One of the toughest jobs in Iraq right now is that of the militarydoctor. CNN medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, has been travelingwith the Devil Docs throughout the war and now they are close to Baghdad. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : Each of these bangs and explosions comes with a story. Some we'll neverknow. For others, the stories can be seen in their injuries. Nobody knowsthese stories better than the Devil Docs, Naval corpsmen who never lookthe other way, but rather face what needs to be done without flinching.They are often the first faces the injured see, be they Iraqi orcoalition force members. Even while statutes were coming down and therewas dancing in the streets, the consequences of continuing firefights areseen here. The work of the Devil Docs is by no means over. The Navy hasset up a helicopter landing zone just a 100 meters from a mobileoperating room, just on the outskirts of Baghdad. This is the closestfront line surgical company. Corpsmen quickly take patients by ambulanceaway from the blowing sand to a triage tent. It is there the doctorsbegin their work. Over 45 minutes as we watched, 32 patients weredelivered here, evaluated and nine operations started; 29 of thosedelivered, Marines involved in a firefight in the center of Baghdad.Their stories could be seen in the shrapnel wounds of rocket-propelledgrenades and bullet wounds from semi-automatic weapons. The operationsare on their hands, abdomen and face. Two of the Marines, too far gone.For many of the survivors, that news is the most difficult to handle.Along with the medical care, hands are held, spirits are lifted.

===========Input: Virtually No Resistance In Tikrit, Supposedly Place of Saddam's Last 
Stand MILES O'BRIEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : The people of Tikrit are saying Saddam's family left that city three daysago, well before the Americans arrived. Saddam's clan is said to haveleft for a small village in the desert. 12:19 p.m.: CNN's Ryan Chilcotereports the 101st Airborne 2nd Brigade finds 11 of what an Army generaldescribes as chem-bio labs buried to avoid detection near Karbala, eachof the structures 20-by- 20 feet. And the military also found over 1,000pounds of documents buried at the site. U.S. inspections will continuethere. WOODRUFF : Well, Baghdad is a city where drinking water and working telephones arehot commodities. Now, regular cell phones rarely work these days in thecity, we're told, but satellite phones are another story entirely. CNN'sRula Amin reports from the Iraqi capital. RULA AMIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) : They wait for hours to find a journalist and they plead with us to borrowour mobile satellite phones. They need to send a message to theirfamilies abroad just to tell them, "We are alive," says this woman. Here,they wait outside a restaurant where journalists hang out. And they aredesperate. "Only for one minute," says this mother. She wants to call herpregnant daughter Saba (ph) in Sweden to see if she has delivered. "It'snot good for her to worry about us," she says. Across the fence, a21-year-old U.S. Marine named Jason Cook (ph) is after the same phones.He wants to call his mom in Houston. A "New York Times" reporter lendsCook his mobile sat phone. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I love you too, mom. Hey, old man. I'm in the middle of Baghdad, justpatrolling up and down the streets. AMIN : Cook hasn't spoken to his family since Super Bowl Sunday, January 26. Onthis one sidewalk in Baghdad, they were all doing the most natural thingduring war, trying to reach their loved ones. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : My mother, brother and sister. AMIN (on camera) : How many do you have? UNIDENTIFIED MALE : I got an older brother and a little brother and sister. AMIN (voice-over) : His mother told him to keep his head down. UNIDENTIFIED MALE : She didn't believe I was really talking to her. AMIN : We do our share. And the first to call is the mother. Saba hasn'tdelivered yet. Nevertheless, the mother is happy. Everyone wanted tocall. We couldn't accommodate everybody. So, on small notes, they wrotethe phone numbers we didn't get to dial, hoping we'd deliver on ourpromise that we'd call on their behalf. Rula Amin, CNN, Baghdad. WOODRUFF : Makes you wish they had enough satellite phones to go around foreverybody. Thanks, Rula. Up next: the commander-in-chief's politicalfuture. Now that the war is winding down, is his support among Democratslooking up?

===========Input: Interview With Donald Rumsfeld; Lugar, Dodd Talk About Post-War Iraq; 
Kissinger, Cohen Discuss Middle East Road Map BLITZER : Welcome back to LATE EDITION. We return now to my interview earlier todaywith the United States defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. BLITZER : I know during the war, before the war, you were very concerned about theposition of the Syrian government, cooperating with Iraqis, having anopen border, if you will. Has the situation improved, especially in theaftermath now of the secretary of state's meeting with Bashar al-Asad? RUMSFELD : Well, I guess time will tell. I talked to Secretary Powell this morningon the phone a bit, and it's not, I think you need to let the dust settleon that. He's, in my judgment, had a visit that was worth doing, and thepresident asked him to do it, and it was the right thing to do. We'll seewhat progress comes. You know, words are one thing, actions are another. BLITZER : But right now you're open-minded as far as Syria on whether they willcrack down on terrorism, take some of the other steps that you want themto take? RUMSFELD : I know what they've been doing, and it's been unhelpful. I know thatSecretary Powell was just there and advised them that it was unhelpful,and gave them some pointers and some suggestions for the future. In myview, they were making some unwise decisions previously. What they'll doafter this visit remains to be seen. BLITZER : The secretary of state has written you a letter expressing, apparently,some concern about the length that the prisoners are going to bespending, those detained at the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo Bay inCuba, about 600 or so of them. Is there any movement in trying todetermine the fate of these individuals? RUMSFELD : I don't think that's quite accurate as to what he wrote me about. BLITZER : All right, tell me what... RUMSFELD : I think what he wrote me about was the fact that the inter-agencyprocess, where we have all these FBI and Department of Justice and CIAand DIA, and what have you, involved in interrogating these detainees, ittakes time to find out what intelligence they have. It also takes time tofigure out what law enforcement process might be appropriate, and whatColin and I have been concerned about, both of us, is that it's taking solong. There are a number of countries, and the Department of State hasthe responsibility of dealing with those countries, that have foreignnationals in Gitmo, in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, being detained, and thosecountries, understandably, would like to know when they could have thosepeople.So the inter-agency process takes a great deal of time. Colin andI are trying to speed up that process, and that's what that's all about. BLITZER : Let me just, a couple of nuggets to sort of wrap up before I let you go.Victory parades for the troops. I remember covering General Schwarzkopf,the parades in Washington and New York after the first Gulf War. Do youwant the troops to be honored in that way when they come back, to haveparades in New York, Washington, elsewhere? RUMSFELD : There's no question but that the troops, the young men and women, didsuch a superb job that there has to be a way to honor them, and therewill be. And General Franks and his team have done just a superb job forour country and for the world, and indeed for the Iraqi people, who havebeen liberated. What's the best way to do that? In the case of 1991, thetask was to go in and get them out of Kuwait, and they did it, and theywere properly greeted coming back to the United States. In this instance,it was a very different task. It was to remove that regime, and it's partof a global war on terrorism that is not over. We still have to face theproblem of a number of global terrorist networks and terrorist statesthat exist, that work with those global networks. And on the one hand wewill, in fact, find a way to honor the courage and dedication and talentof these young men and women, and we'll do it well. Whether it will bemodeled off the 1991 thing, I don't know. I kind of doubt it, becauseit's such a different circumstance. Certainly, our war plan was notmodeled off of 1991. BLITZER : One final question on North Korea. If the North Koreans pursue theirnuclear weapons ambitions... RUMSFELD : Yes. BLITZER : ... a preemptive strike, is that something that is out there? RUMSFELD : I'm not one who speculates about things like that. I know that back inthe 1990s, in the Clinton administration, Secretary Perry called in theformer secretaries of defense, and we had a discussion, and they clearlyhad teed up a military option that they were considering, and they thenat a certain moment were able to do some things that persuaded them thatthat was not appropriate. But those are very serious issues, and I leavethem for the president.

===========Input: Interview With Donald Rumsfeld; Lugar, Dodd Talk About Post-War Iraq; 
Kissinger, Cohen Discuss Middle East Road Map BLITZER : President Bush aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln on Thursday, formallydeclaring the successful accomplishment of the military mission in Iraq.Welcome back to LATE EDITION. Joining us now are two key members of theUnited States Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In his home state ofIndiana, the committee's chairman, Republican Senator Richard Lugar. Andhere in Washington, Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut.Senators, welcome back to LATE EDITION. Mr. Chairman, let me begin withyou. Are you among those who are beginning to conclude that, when all thedust settles, the U.S. may not find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? SEN. RICHARD LUGAR (R), INDIANA : No, I concur with Secretary Powell, Secretary Rumsfeld, the president,that weapons of mass destruction are there, and likewise, that we will beled to them by people knowledgeable in the country as to where they are.What form we may find them and what traces of destruction and all therest of it will be very interesting and, likewise, the intellectualcapital that is there to produce more. Because not much else is -- youdon't need much to get it going again. And that, I think, we have to beworking with these people who are in the business to make sure they don'tre-enter the business, much as we did with Russian scientists under theNunn-Lugar program. BLITZER : What about you, Senator Dodd, do you believe, in the end, they will findweapons of mass destruction? SEN. CHRISTOPHER DODD (D), CONNECTICUT : I have no evidence to the contrary. And certainly, they have used them inthe past. There's no doubt about that at all, both in Iran and againstthe Kurdish population. So, whether or not they find them in the exactform that many would assume they would be the case -- possibly some gotout of the country. It wouldn't surprise me to hear that. But I'm goingto work on the assumption, based on the intelligence that has beengathered, that the weapons of mass destruction existed. BLITZER : What if they don't? DODD : Well, you know, they've used it in the past, and I think the point thatSenator Lugar just made -- certainly having the intellectual capacity todo this was proven already by the fact they've used them in the past. So,I wouldn't dwell on that point specifically, because Saddam Husseinclearly was a producer and a user of biological and chemical weapons. Heclearly was on the track to acquire a nuclear capacity, and the world isa safer place today because he's not ruling Iraq. BLITZER : Will the U.S. lose creditability, Mr. Chairman, if, if the U.S. finds nohard evidence, no so-called smoking gun? LUGAR : No, we have full credibility in Iraq. We've prosecuted with the alliancea successful liberation of the Iraqi people, and we have clearly causedSaddam to destroy weapons of mass destruction, or at least to suppressevidence of them. That is a victory of sorts.This is a facet that'simportant. It's important in the war against terrorism that we rout outwhatever is there and, likewise, the people involved, because they mighthelp supply al Qaeda or other terrorists along the trail. BLITZER : Senator Dodd, how important is it for the U.S. to conclusively learn whathappened to Saddam Hussein? DODD : Well, it's important. But I don't think it's as important as findingOsama bin Laden, for the simple reason that I don't think Saddam Husseintoday poses any threat, wherever he is. If he is alive, obviously, hedoesn't pose the kind of threat that an Osama bin Laden does with hiscellular network around the world to reactivate al Qaeda andinternational terrorism. So, it would certainly be good to know where heis. It would be, certainly, to know, to apprehend him, to bring himbefore a court of justice. But I don't think it's absolutely critical forthe ultimate success of this mission that we apprehend him or find outwhat happened to him. BLITZER : And you agree with that assessment, Mr. Chairman? LUGAR : Yes, I think that Senator Dodd is right on.

===========Input: Interview With Donald Rumsfeld; Lugar, Dodd Talk About Post-War Iraq; 
Kissinger, Cohen Discuss Middle East Road Map BLITZER : What about the length of the U.S. military presence in Iraq, SenatorLugar? How long do you anticipate large numbers of U.S. troops willremain there? LUGAR : Well, I was heartened by what Secretary Rumsfeld told you in the lastinterview, that we will have troops there as long as necessary, but nolonger than necessary. I think that's a pretty good way to state it. Myown view is that the security of the country clearly is ourresponsibility presently. We are trying to pass that on to others.Likewise, the other government's procedures, the fledgling beginnings ondemocracy, and all the rest. But that's going to require an undergirding.Now, in due course, as everybody points out, we may get help from othercountries. We may bring in NATO allies or the United Nations or otherpeople in the Arab world. That would be helpful. But for the moment, thisis our responsibility. And we ought not to be having large debates abouthow rapidly we move out. And I was upset, in a way, to hear reports thatby the fall, three divisions out of five would be gone. I think SecretaryRumsfeld disabused us of that today. BLITZER : And what about you, Senator Dodd, not only the length of time, but thecost to U.S. taxpayers? Have you been given any ballpark estimate whatthis is going to cost the United States? DODD : No. Well, what we've heard the numbers of reconstruction running around$100 billion. We put $2.5 billion in, in the last supplementalappropriations bill. So it's going to be costly. These RFPs, theseseeking bids on various contracts are rather costly, and so it's going tobe expensive. And clearly the responsibility is going to fall principallyon the United States. Now, I would hope that sooner rather than later wecould see a civilian government emerge in Iraq, a democratically electedone, that there'd be more cooperation from the international community,on both the peacekeeping side as well as the political restructuringthat's necessary in Iraq. And to the extent we can move that along morequickly, I think we're all going to be better off. Being the sole, oralmost the sole power there, both in terms of reconstruction andpolitically, exposes us to great vulnerabilities. BLITZER : Senator Lugar, we have to take a quick break, but before we do, I wantedto just ask you, the U.N. role -- you say there could be a U.N. role. Doyou specifically want the United Nations to have some sort ofpeacekeeping role there? And secondarily, what about countries likeFrance, Germany, and Russia, which opposed the Bush administration's warplans, do you want them shut out? LUGAR : No, I don't want anybody shut out. And I do hope the United Nations willplay a vital role in Iraq, whether it be in peacekeeping or various otherways, and I hope that that will occur soon. I think we really need aninternationalization of the process, for the very reasons that SenatorDodd pointed out. BLITZER : All right. We're going to take that quick break. Stand by, Senators. Wehave a lot more ground to cover. Senators Lugar and Dodd will be stayingwith us. They'll also be taking your phone calls. LATE EDITION willcontinue right after this.

===========Input: we begin we will finish. [ applause ]d the extra $400 per child toamerican families this year, 2003. all together these tax reductionswill help 92 million americans. and a significant part of the benefitto our economy will come within the first two years of the plan. afamily of four with an income of $40,000 would receive a 96% reductionin federal income taxes. instead of paying $1,178 per year, the familywould pay $45 a year. [ applause ] that means extra money in thefamily budget year after year. that money can cover a lot of bills.that money can help families with purchases they have been delaying.that money will be in circulation, which will be good for our economy.[ applause ] and this plan will help our small business sector. thebenefits of the growth plan will come from uncreased consumer spendingand, as importantly, from a lower income tax rates on the smallbusinesses themselves. it is important for our fellow citizens tounderstand that most small businesses pay their business taxes at theindividual rates. most small businesses are sole proprietorships,limited partnerships, are subchapter ss, and, therefore, when youreduce individual tax rates, you benefit small business formation. asa matter of fact, under this plan, some 23 million small businessowners will see their taxes cut. which leaves more money forinvestment, more money for growth, more money for job creation. agrowing economy also needs small business investment. and our tax codeshould encourage investment. today a small business can deduct amaximum of $25,000 in the year in which they buy equipment. we need totriple the amount that can be deducted in the year in which they buyequipment. [ applause ] so i propose to congress that they ought tolimit -- limit ought to be increased to $75,000 and that limit oughtto be indexed to inflation. by doing so, we promote greater investmentin machinery. and when a small business bias machine that enhancestheir company's product divty as well as it means machinerymanufacturer is likely to have more work available. more investmentequals jobs. and what we are interested in in this administration ishelping people who look for work find a job. [ applause ] we can alsopromote economic growth and job creation by removing the double tax ondividends. [ applause ] taxing corporate income once is fair. it isnot fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice. theburden of double taxation falls on the millions of individuals whoreceive dividends. falls especially hard on seniors who receive halfof all dividend income. removal of double taxation would put moremoney in the hands of investors. it would encourage more investment inamerican businesses. economists say that this plan will help our stockmarkets, and since half of american families own stock, the reformwill help them save and help our economy grow. now, these measureswere presented to congress in the first week of this year. the progrowth package was urgent in january. it's even more urgent today. [applause ] it is important for you all to understand and for ourfellow americans to understand the tax relief that i have proposed andwill push for until enacted would create -- [ applause ] will create1.4 million new jobs by the end of 2004. in two years time, thisnation has experienced war, a recession and a national emergency.which has caused our government to run a deficit. the best way toreduce the deficit is with more growth in our economy, which meansmore revenues to our treasury, and less spending in washington, d.c. [applause ] i am pleased that both the house and senate have passedbudget resolutions that show real spending restraint. and now thecongress must focus on a robust and effective growth package. we needat least $550 billion in that package because the more tax relief thatgoes to the american people, the more jobs we will create in thiseconomy. [ applause ] the last few months have been a time ofchallenge for america. our resolve has been tested. yet we have thegreat resources of national strength. and national character. toovercome every challenge we face. our confidence an our optimism havenever waivered. we are defending the peace of the world. we'rebringing freedom to corners of the world who haven't seen freedom inyears. we're all building the prosperity of our country. this is aunique moment in our history and the american people are rising tomeet it. i want to thank each of you for your hard work. i want tothank each of you for the faith you have shown in this country'sfuture. may god bless you, and may god continue to bless america.

===========Input: we'll continue to watch this cramma unfold off key largo in florida.let's much on to another important story. it's happened, of course,several times during the war in iraq, journalists caught in the lineof fire and killed. israeli troops are facing a similar situation withtwo journalists killed in just the past two weeks. here's cnn's clywallace. reporter: friday night in the gaza strip and a journalist is about tolose his life. shortly after several shots are heard an israelibulldozer can be seen uncovering the israelis say, a tunnel used tosmuggle weapons. moments later, three journalists who were coveringthat israeli action appear. one with tv labeled on the back of abullet-proof vest, another carrying a white flag. judging from thevideotape, they appear difficult to see in the darkness. and difficultto hear. after the journalists shout, another gunshot. moments later,another shot and the sound of someone in pain. 34-year-old britishjournalist james miller died on the scene after israeli soldiers cometo his aid, the israeli defense sources says. he is best known for hiswork on two award-winning documentaries which appeared on cnn exposingthe world to the taliban rule in afghanistan. now the foreign pressassociation in israel is calling for an independent investigation. james was not shooting and he was not with somebody shooting. so,again, to know exactly what happened we need a full-fledged inquiry. the israeli government said its forces were returning fire and thatmiller was shot in the back, suggesting he could have been hit bypalestinian gunmen. those close to miller believe he was shot by anarmored israeli personnel carrier. we know the israelis fired. whetheror not he was shot by israelis gunfire, we are not certain at thistime. miller becomes the second journalist in just two weeks to bekilled covering the israeli-palestinian conflict. with palestiniancameramen, shot and killed by an israeli soldier on the west bank inmid-april. with back-to-back deaths making a total of at least sevenjournalists killed covering the conflict in the past two and a halfyears. this is very worrying and i believe the israeli army should takespecial measures to prevent this. the message from the israeligovernment is that its soldiers are not targeting journalists, butthat journalists who travel to places where there could be live fireexchange between israeli forces and palestinian gunmen have aresponsibility to take greater precautions. they have to realize that this is not a game going on there. it's alife and death situation. soldiers are basically thinking about theirown lives at that moment. they don't have time to hesitate. theisraeli spokesman says the soldier his no choice, but to be there.journalists say

===========Input: welcome back to "people in the news." the intifada, the spontaneous 1987 palestinian uprising against theisraeli occupation, heralded the rise of the muslim fundamentalism. inwhat had been a mostly secular palestinian movement. the most popularof these groups hamas, an acronym for islamic resistance movement. inenglish it means zeal, its aim -- the destruction of israel. hamas is an islamic movement. at the very beginning, it was encouragedby israel because they thought it was a counter weight to palestiniannationalism which is, of course, a secular movement. hamas was founded in 1988 by a blind paraplegic cleric who wasinfluenced by the islamic muslim brotherhood, with backing fromisrael, he set up sharities in the improverished strip in the 1970s. slowly it became more and more politicized, and more and more extremein its demands for an islamic state. the extremism took the form of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks.but hamas had already become an important part of palestinian societythrough its charity work and its influence increased over time byproviding community services when the palestinian authority did not. hamas plays on the palestinian authority's failure to produce. itsbasic message, the palestinian authority is corrupt, it fails todeliver, hamas is not corrupt. hamas cares about the person on thestreet and it does deliver. unfortunately, those same charitableorganizations, those same charity committees that funnel the funds toneedier palestinians, also serve to support terrorist attacks. israel and the united states say arafat has not been tough enough onterrorism, and have attempted to force him out of the current peaceprocess. the prime minister known as abu mazen must now contend withthe rejection of side by side palestinian and israeli states. acornerstone of the new peace plan. he's trying to get hamas to co-exist with israel. conservative israelis are skeptical. he is not working against hamas, he is working in tandem. he isnegotiating with them. he is not telling them to disband and regulatetheir weapons, so i have no faith in the ability of abu mazen to putterror aside. reporter: settlers call the just concluded israeli-american-palestinian summit a surrender, and were not impressed. translator: the armed intifada must end and we must use and resort topeaceful means in our quest to end the occupation and the suffering ofthe palestinians, and the israelis, and to establish the palestinianstate. hamas and other palestinian militant group rejected abbas' call to endtheir attacks with a deadly raid on an israeli army outpost in gaza. we are all saying that the resistance will continue despite the summitin aqaba. israel retaliated on hamas, namely al-rantissi, it missed him andkilled civilians. translator: hamas will not drop our weapons, even if all leaders areassassinated. reporter: since the second intifada began in 2000, over 700 israelishave been killed, during the same time there have been more than 2,000palestinian deaths according to the red crescent. including hamasleaders targeted for assassination. if you want an end to terrorism, if you want an end to violence, youhave to give people hope and you have to give them a stake in thepolitical process. i think that hamas is ready to join the politicalprocess, however, if the only price for the political price is youmust fight hamas, if that's what they are requiring abu mazen to do,they are almost mandating that he will fail. the main test of mahmoud abbas, will be to establish an overallcommand of all armed groups, if not, it doesn't have a chance. youknow, leaders have to do things

===========Input: the nasa and the european space agency both launch missionsto mars this month sending rovers and ashters to probe thered planet. one of the big questions about mars is when orwhether humans will ever be able to visit. it's an ideaplagued with unsolved problems. the latest issue of"popular science magazine" takes a look at the challengesnasa is facing. joining us is the contributing editor. goodto see you, jeff. thank you. it was only about 30 years ago when we went to the moon. sowhat's the difficulty in being able to go to mars? it's unimaginably difficult and different. mars is at mosttimes 100 million miles away from us. it's a nine-monthtrip. then if we stay there for about a year or two, thewhole trip could last about three years. we're talkingabout conditions where there's radiation in space cosmicradiation that could cause cancer. the communicationsconditions once you're on mars, just to talk to people onearth, there's a 20 minute delay in the conversation. sothe -- you know, the issues are so much larger than goingto the moon. and for now, it's 250 days, which seems to be the maximumfor astronauts in space anyway. but as you say, it's a muchfurther travel. but let's talk about some of the hurdlesthat hamper humans to be able to survive there. the dust,for one thing. cataracts another. let's talk about theright kind of spacecraft that would be able to allow humansto actually get that far and to survive. right. well, first of all, the spacecraft would not belaunched from earth. you'd have to launch is from in spacealready, which means we would have to build it in space. sothat means we need a good shuttle that's going to take usback and forth to build the spacecraft. then we have tocome up with the fuel that will take it out of the earth'sorbit all the way to mars. that's probably going to benuclear propulsion at this point again something we haven'treally developed yet, because we couldn't carry that muchfuel, obviously. liquid oxygen would be way too heavy tocarry all the way to mars. the bigger issue is once we getthere, we can't carry oxygen or water or food to stay therethree years, so we're going to have to do all of that onthe surface of the planet. and think of it. mars is carbondioxide. so we can't breathe there. so we're going to haveto come up with some conversion technique to create water,to create oxygen and then some way of growing food on theplanet itself. all of this is in the works now, but i thinkit's going to take quite a few years to develop it. you talk about the cosmic radiation. then of course thereis the zero g bone loss, almost like the eroding of bone tohumans that would be at risk as well. absolutely. there could be as much as 50% bone loss inastronauts in mars. why? during the time in mars. because when the body has -- whenthere is no dpravity as there is on mars, the body doesn'tpick up the calcium in the bones, so it doesn't keepgetting the bones stronger and stronger. so they will justlose it. they will be almost like old people even at theage of 40. jeff rothfeder. thank you for joining us. looks like itwill be some time before we make our way to mars. that's itfor us. but before we go, a look at what's coming up nextweek. a controversial incinerator just about ready todestroy weapons at an anniston, alabama, military facility.what might be the risk to people downwind. that story andmuch more coming up next week. coming up next on "cnn livesunday" a look at america's storage of gas. that's followedby "people in the news" profiling harrison ford and harrypotter. at 8:00 eastern, cnn presents road to baghdad.

Suzanne : um -- I am reluctant to see another Bush brother on the ticket for theRepublicans Sara : Mhm. Suzanne : but I think that putting Jeb Bush would make h- -- the Republican ticketeasier to defeat. Sara : Mhm. Suzanne : um -- I really don't think that Hillary Clinton -- would be -- a good choicefor the Democrats. Sara : Yeah. Suzanne : um I don't think Barak Obama would be a very good choice for theDemocrats. Sara : Uh-huh. Suzanne : Just because he's -- he's really young, and he's going to be startingoff his career.

Sara : um -- trying to think who else -- Arnold Schwarzenegger I don't think --well he's not qualified anyway, but Suzanne : Well, they might change something, you know, between now and then. Sara : I've heard people say that would take a -- I I don't think they will.uh That takes a Constitutional amendment. That's pretty hard to -- toget through. Suzanne : Well, I mean, you live in California. How is he doing -- in your state? Sara : Oh, I think he's done all right, um -- I I -- He's a he's a moderateRepublican, you know, he's not Suzanne : Right.

Oh no, no,he's too young, and he came from that little, little podunk -- g- uhstate he never did anything. I said, he's going to be President. I wastelling all my friends. I said, you know, and I was before -- theysaid, well, I thought you supported George Bush, and I said, well Idid support George Bush, but he doesn't know what he's doing and heneeds to go.

And with the constant merging with otherbanks, A : Yeah. B : ugh err. A : Or well, and then you think of things like Enron. B : Oh yeah. A : I mean,  you got -- corrupted chiefs too. B : Yeah, they're everywhere. The uh ~CEO we had before we merged withNations Bank -- he uh -- he about ran as into the ground with some hedgefunds that he had gone into. A : Uh-huh. B : And then, and then when we finish merging, they give the guy somethinglike a twenty-five million dollar package, and if he dies, his familystill gets all the money. A : No way. B : Yeah.  No.  They wouldn't do anything like that for me.  I've beenthere for a long time, I used to be a manager there. There's no wayI'd get that kind of a -- oh.  So, yeah, once you get way up there,unless you're prosecuted,  you you just -- are constantly rolling in thedough. A : Yeah.

They have goodbenefits. A : Yeah. B : Not good pay. A : Yeah.  Yeah I I'm not really familiar with the working world thatmuch.  So, I mean, with my part-time job, it's a lot it's really goodfor a student, because I only work uh two hours a night. B : Oh that's good. A : So, yeah, and then it's pretty flexible.

What kind of job do you have?Describe some of the people that you work with and the jobs they do.Do you think your company is well-run?  If not, what could make itbetter? Bill : Hello. Alexander : Hi, this is Alexander from Minnesota. Bill : Yeah, I'm Bill from, uh, Tampa, Florida. Alexander : Hey, g- interesting topic. Bill : Yeah. Alexander : Eh, what kind of job do you do, sir? What does the work at your place? Bill : Well, actually, I'm self employed.  And I, uh, what I do is I -- wholesale -- cars.  So, I I really don't have any workers, I just -- work bymyself.  Uh, I guess -- I just have one that helps me once in a while topick up cars and -- deliver them.  But, uh,  that's uh -- interesting thatthey called me on that. Alexander : So you guys -- but what kind of culture do you have if you work twopeople work, that should be some sort of every place has Bill : But Alexander : the atmosphere of, you know, how things are done, who's in command andhow, you know, decisions are made, and Bill : Right.  And they also did say that, uh, previous work places, too, so Alexander : Yeah. Okay, wh- uh I I Bill : I can talk about that.  Where wh- Alexander : Go a- go ahead, you can talk about your previous work place. Bill : Yeah, wh- -- Yeah, I was going to ask you where you work, too. Alexander : I work with a pharmaceutical company. I we -- have a little over threehundred and some ((million)) employees. Bill : Oh wow.  And what do you do there? Alexander : You know.  I work as a patient care advocate. And I -- I work as anonli- I do online, you know, online, uh, pharmaceutical company -- whereI have -- filled and -- refilled take orders sent back to us online. Bill : Oh, okay. That's interesting. Alexander : And, you know,  and I have a company, as well, set up. I think we havethe account manager, and we have -- the vice president. We have super-team lead- team leads, uh I and then have operations specialist. Wehave, you know, I -- team managers, training managers. It's a very bigcompany. Yeah, and I think that the atmosphere is very good, I Bill : Right. Alexander : Yeah. Bill : Well, I think that's important to to have a good atmosphere and also,uh,  uh, i- know who who really is in charge,  uh, you know, and andknow who you have to answer to.  Because sometimes, y- I I I did Iyears ago I had a company that was, uh,  it was,  uh, I was a subs- s-captive sub-contractor for making packaging material.  And, um,  therewere a lot of salesmen in the company,  they had a tendency to,  youknow, there was there was, uh, a chain of command, you might say. Youknow, there was, uh, the person that was the, uh,  head of theorganization.  But, all the salesmen -- used to come around and giveorders, too, you know.  So it made it kind of difficult for the m-for my employees, because they would the salesmen would be coming out,uh,  uh, without consulting with the one that was in charge.  Theywould just be coming out and giving orders when they should alreadywent through him.  So it made it difficult.  So I I I think it'sreally important to h- have that really clear.  That that there's someorganized way to deal with, uh,  problems and orders and things likethat, and if there is a problem, then -- you go to the person who's incharge and -- then they can handle it.  So, that was -- that that's just ayou know, a -- previous, uh,  type of work that I had.  And I and tha- Ithink that's what they wanted us to talk about, too, right? Alexander : Yeah. Yeah, that's that's that's I think it's just basically, is (())one of the things I perceive is if- what kind of, you know,environment is it, and is it inviting is it, you know, all that they Iguess that's what they're aiming at.  You know, it's not a place whereeverybody trying to give instruction and everybody trying to do, youknow.  Uh, but I for my job is i- i- -- we have us a very diverse feel.We have a lot of people who are from different country, and,  youknow, and -- I think they are pretty much accepting, and I,  you know,I- bas- basically you- you can promote yourself if you do a good job,I mean,  they don't pick and choose, you know. Bill : Right. Alexander : It's a very -- environment that allows you to grow in.  And I think theythinks I rightfully don't, if -- like if I have a problem, like,  I'llfreshly go to my team lead or the supervisor and she takes it to herboss, and,  you know, the boss takes it to the next level and,  youknow, something like that. Bill : Right.  Yeah, but that -- I feel like that that's very important. Uh,for a company to be well-run, it has to have, uh,  a c- it's t- has tobe able to send a clear message -- as to how to handle problems and whowho is the one that's uh,  uh, indicated for -- for those problems -- tohandle.  And and people -- those in the company need to be uminstructed -- to know wh- where their relative place is in the company.So that they they don't overstep their bounds. Alexander : Yeah. Bill : Because when that happens, and it that makes, uh, that createsproblems for the employees. It makes them discontent.  I mean, if theyif they can be, eh, um,  you know, jumped on arbitrarily by just aboutanybody,  then pretty soon, you know, they're they're they're notgoing to be content at all, they're just going to wonder, well whenwhen's the next hit going to come, you know.  When's somebody elsegoing to jump on me?

A : He he's very honest, he's very strong in his beliefs, and I'm sorry tosee him go.  I'm also sorry to see Tom Ridge resigning.  Um B : I am too, and you know what, I don't where, do you know anything abouthis background? I don't know where he came from. A : he's the Governor of, he was the Governor of Pennsylvania. B : Oh, that's right. Okay. A : And um after uh B : Now I remember. A : he before nine eleven, he was -- he was on an advisory committal --committee -- to the Gover- to the President I guess,  besides himrunning uh Pennsylvania, and then after nine eleven they appointed himyou know, head of Homeland Security, and then created the B : Uh-huh. A : uh Secretary's position for him,  or for someone, but him being theperson at that time. I just think that B : Yeah.  Yeah. A : it's so soon -- since nine eleven, and he has been creating his ownjob, i- in essence, because it's such a new position.  But, I thinkit's -- it would've been -- better to have one person -- like continuingthat.  However, B : I do too. I I do too. I hate to I hate to change -- change horses thereso quickly. A : yeah. B : Uh I I I'd that -- that -- job uh uh needs continuity -- for a while.Anyhow.  You know, I m- I mean, at least until they get A : Yeah. B : settled on what the job really is. A : Yeah, well uh maybe maybe on one hand -- somebody new will bring a newperspective to it, which would -- be helpful, but I still think that B : Uh yeah A : the people that are up for it -- there's some p- B : Yeah, but if it's if the perspective is too new, you know, that's notgoing to be a good thing, because uh wholesale changes is not whatthey need to do. A : yeah.  Yeah. B : Uh uh no matter who takes it over. They need to they need to -- thinklong and hard before they start making changes.  Because if they makeone wrong one, you know, it A : But there are there are a couple women up for -- the position as well asum you know, a few men that are up for the position.  And I don't knowanything about the women that are up for the position. Um -- one -- two ofthe men are from New York, one is a Head of -- the the -- who was there atnine eleven. He was the Chief of Police.  Or the Commissioner -- of ofpolice I guess.  Uh who was with Giuliani throughout the whole thing. B : Uh-huh. A : Um they're also thinking about Giuliani, so -- I mean, I think they havesome qualified candidates. B : Yeah. A : However,  I think -- with it's Homeland Security, which means it can'tjust be New York, which is where of course, their focus is going tobe. B : Sure. A : Having -- you know, been there, and through that.  So, as long as theydon't have blinders on,  you know,  I would be okay with that, butthey've got to look, obviously -- at ports -- nuclear power plants, youknow, and oth- other areas where we are vulnerable. B : Yeah.  Yeah, and you know what's really scary to me? I I don't I'venever seen it mentioned, I've never -- but -- but if they really wanted toto I don't know uh uh uh if they if they really wanted to put -- fear inthe American people,  uh -- I know it would work with me,  is if theysay just uh if if -- I say they, Bin Laden, or who whoever -- uh -- uh isrunning that team now, uh were to -- were to just pick a small -- Mid-American town, A : Mhm. B : uh and just wipe it out, A : Yeah, no, and I I thi- I think that's a great fear. B : you know, and there are a lot of ways -- there are a lot of ways to dothat. I mean, I mean, it wouldn't take a nuclear weapon. A : No, no. B : uh uh and it it could be done so easily because i- i- most small townsare protected by a small town police force. A : Mhm. B : You know? And that's it. A : Well, I think that -- there's -- really -- been a strengthening, and I hopethey can -- get it together without this.  Part of the problem with thatis the ~CIA and the ~FBI and who's going to be in charge because theywant to create this new position. B : ((I)) No, they've always A : And, so nobody wants to -- give up -- power B : Yeah.

Bush Cabinet President Bush has just been elected to another termin office, and he has already started to appoint new people to hispolitical cabinet as current members like Colin Powell and JohnAshcroft resign.  Who would you like to see appointed to his cabinetnext term?  Who are they, and why do you think they should beappointed? If you were president, which national figures would youappoint to your cabinet and why?  What new cabinet positions would youcreate and who would fill them? A : And the one that, oh what's the -- the guy that, um -- Tom Ridge just re-resigned yesterday. He was another one that was -- I didn't really knowthat much about him. I mean, I guess he was kind of the first -- one onthat homeland security or, in charge of that.  But I heard that theywere going to -- one of the possible candidates is the the guy he usedto be the chief of police of New York.  Well that's somebody to methat's going to have some good -- insight into, you know, what it takesyou know -- to -- keep a city secure. You know, because New York, I don'tknow if you've ever been there B : Yeah, I went there ((before)) A : has has has got some -- different rules from Texas as far as -- you knowyou know, running the city.  I mean I, there's a lot lot more peopledense population up there than there is in in Texas and they probablywould have uh the pol- uh the police chief would probably know -- wellwhat can work in like, airports or, you know, things, situations likethat. He was, he was a pretty good -- pretty smart person. But I, itdidn't -- I can't remember his name, but -- the, I saw an interview withhim, and -- how he, uh -- ran New York and uh -- you know, some of the -- ru-you know, they changed some of the rules, uh -- uh, not rules, but theway they -- uh B : The management team A : protected the city. The the police kind of changed their tactics and,because there was a lot of -- oh -- run down areas, and a lot of crime andthey, you know -- got -- cleaned it up, and and -- they passed some lawsthat said, you know, you couldn't, I think it was like, um -- you know,like homeless people that -- carrying -- uh -- you know, shopping carts, orsomething like that, and it sounds -- small -- to outlaw that. But theyoutlawed that because they said a lot of people were stealing stuff.They'd stick them in the shopping carts and push them down the road.You wouldn't know, oh, they're just a homeless person. Well they cutthat out and they found out -- it cut down on the theft.  Uh -- I guesspeople -- hide them in their basket and -- or taking something and thenstick in their basket and the police never -- you know, bothered them.Well, the homeless people -- I guess, they need their shopping cart, sothey kind of went elsewhere, so -- um -- I mean it's a small thing,  butit was, they just figured out, they were -- you know, uh -- learning fromexperience on what they need to do in the -- city and -- I think he wouldbe a good -- candidate for the Homeland Security,  running that. B : But, eh, for the foreign po- uh this is all all what you are saying islike, about the internal -- but what about the external policy orsomething like that? Whom do you think would be suitable? A : The what now policy? B : Like, eh, foreign po- or international policy or external or A : Mhm. B : uh, whom do you think -- would be suitable for this position? A : To run foreign policy?  Um -- like, uh -- well, it was -- Colin Powell wasSecretary, was he Secretary of State? Is that what that was? B : Yeah. A : And Condoleezza Rice is going to step into that position, the way Iunderstand it, uh. B : Yeah, that's right. A : Yes.  You know, she may be -- uh uh uh, you know, uh -- a uh Bush yesperson, you know, I don't know, uh B : Yeah, so I I don't think this will change too much I mean. A : well mo- most -- most -- aides to the President, if it was -- you know, Iguess when it was Clinton it was, they'd probably be kind of yespeople too, but, I mean they pick the person to -- you know, help themand I guess they're going to have to have -- philosophies and and -- runit the way they would or way they'd want, uh B : Yeah, actually I agree with you. I think uh -- during, uh, Clinton timeuh -- the uh like international policy or the external policy was -- wasmuch better than -- uh what what is happening right now, so.  I think ifwe took Bill Clin- Bill Clinton as like, as a foreign policy -- He hewould be he will do a very good job.  I I would say. A : Mhm. B : Uh, do you think there is uh -- some other, uh like -- positions has to behas been -- has to be created, like uh -- for the next election. A : I'm s- -- say that again. I didn't understand.

Exactly, of course, you're right, you're quite right.

Yeah I think I was -- I think I was -- I was on a cruise, andI put on the television uh when I got in at the six oh clock news, andbingo, there he is, uh resigning as Governor of uh New Jersey.

Do you think he is guilty of the crimes he's been convictedof?  If so, what were his motives?  How closely did you follow thetrial and what do you think of all of the media coverage of the trial?What kind of sentencing should Peterson receive? Christina : Hi. Greg : Hi. Christina : I'm Christina from Connecticut. Greg : I'm Greg from Columbus, Ohio. Christina : Oh, okay. Ooh, Scott Peterson. I was like, I got to talk to someoneabout this. I have to voice my opinion. Well, no, I mean you could goor, well Greg : Uh, I -- Okay, go ahead.  Hey shoot, you got more sense than I do. Christina : Okay, I -- have been following the trial, I don't know why, ever sincethis whole thing happened. I am a stay at home mom, so I get to watchthe ~TV more often, and I -- you know have been fo- -- watching allthese forensic pathologists, Dr. Henry Lee. You know, and and what Isee is that there is no physical evidence that he did it.  And yeah,it sounds like he did do it because he dyed his hair, was trying toget away, and the anchor and a boat. But there's -- -- I for somereason, deep down in my heart, don't believe he did it.  And you knowand I think the media made him guilty, and I think -- it's like youknow, I mean you saw what happened outside the courtroom, I don't knowif you did or not, see how they were cheering on.  I don't think he'sguilty and, I hope he doesn't get the death penalty. And -- I don'tknow.  I I just don't think he's guilty. I think he's wrong, what hedid, everything, he cheated on his wife, that's so wrong, but -- thatdoesn't make him a murderer, he's just a cheater, he's just a -- youknow, like one hundred ten percent you know eighteen karat -- asshole,like i- Mar- Mark Geragos called him. Greg : Yeah. Christina : How about you? You probably think he's guilty, or Greg : Well -- Yeah, no I, I think, I think ((the guy's)) definitely guilty uhJust based on, I haven't followed it all that closely, although youcan't help but follow it closely because there's so much crap on thenews. Christina : Mhm. Greg : But uh no i- the -- uh the I think well first of all, you know I agreewith you, I think cheating on your wife's pretty low.  But I thinkwhat happened i- it's living the b- uh living large.  You could tellboth of them uh you look some of the things they had, you know,  hehad a few bucks or so. (()) finish, things were getting him down, uhyou know, you know how it is, day after day though -- M- marriage isn'tall that wonderful. Christina : Right. Greg : Eh, you know and I don't think he had faced that, and plus, you know,a lot of the neat stuff from the outside, and particularly Amber Frey,who I don't particularly think is neat, but it was something that uhyou know he went after Christina : Mhm. Greg : and so uh he figured, well -- these will, these things would get rid ofher I guess.  I don't, I don't know why like his uh, the wife's or themother said divorce is an option I think. Christina : Yeah.  I know, that's very powerful. Not, you know, not murder and,oh, I mean, I don't know. Greg : But -- you know, I I can see, the guy wasn't thinking right. He wasscrewed up, you know, a despicable human being and he, just -- You know,the easy way out. This'll work, I guarantee I'm too damn smart. Christina : But you know what, it's like I think they didn't want to find himguilty because remember when ~OJ was not found guilty? I mean, oh myGod, the, you know, but it's like, ~LA would have like, turned ~LAupside down, like all the, you know Greg : Yeah. Christina : I- it just, I don't know what would happen if he was found guilty, butnow I think they said that they wanted to prove that -- you know, okay,we're not going to let this guy walk, like, don't let this guy walkeither, big high profile case. Greg : Well, yeah you have to look, see, I think the locale, that both ofthem took place, and one took place in ~LA,  which is terribly open-minded and, uh, the other one took place in uh, Mida- well, uh((Redoak)) City. Christina : Mhm.  Redwood City, yeah. Greg : And who, Redwood City is one of those things that would, uh shift SanFrancisco and ~LA to, uh, to a red state rather than a blue state ifyou let them. It's very, very conservative there.

Um, they brought the boat down, or a duplicate of the boatto, kind of, you know, get a feel for it but they had to remove itfrom Redwood City because people were putting flowers in it in -- memoryof Laci and, you know, planting flowers around it and stuff, so it waspretty interesting.

Hillary : well, you know Kelly : I mean I guess that's not how they decide who died, but it's becauseof the Hillary : you know, and Kelly : the, uh, cou-, like the -- the court that they went to, like the areadoesn't Hillary : well, I don't know why they decided on this, I think it was because itwas so public of a case.  But they have a lot of Kelly : Yeah. Hillary : they have many many worse crimes going on in California, parentskilling their children and everything, that you would think -- wouldwould, um -- you know, be Kelly : Hearing more. Hillary : be more Kelly : Stringent penalties, Hillary : yeah, but they don't, they ignore those because this one got ontelevision, I guess. Kelly : keep like -- uh, the jury from watching ~TV and the media and stuff.But I guess now ((it's, uh)) -- pretty much impossible -- to do. Hillary : I i don't know. I never really got the whole -- watching it on ~TV andand getting into the whole -- mystery of it because, in the end, thewoman's dead and so is her child and -- and -- there's -- really no way ofchanging that I guess. Kelly : Yeah, uh, I think it's kind of strange how it was so publicized.  LikeI'm just, seriously, like I don't, like I try not to watch, like -- toomuch, like Hillary : You can't help it sometimes. Kelly : Yeah I know.  But it just amazes me that, uh, I think it's ridiculoushow publicized -- how much publicity it got because -- I mean there's likehuman rights violations going on all around the world. I mean there'slike, genocide in Sudan right now but like, nobody talks about that.That's like (()) Hillary : Oh yeah and what's going on in, I know and people -- flock, flock to thestore to buy all their -- all their foreign made goods and it's likewhat are you -- doing? Obviously they don't really care about what'sgoing on. They just like to hear the details.  Maybe if they couldhear the details about other things they would be more involved. Idon't know. Kelly : Um (()) it's almost like, uh -- (()) diversion but it just seems likethey just make it into like, like a soap opera for people to watch,you know? Hillary : Well you know, some people were glued to their ~TVs for weeks,  andit's just to disturbing that that would be their -- their mainentertainment during the day. Kelly : Oh yeah, definitely. It's creepy. Hillary : Especially when there's so many other things they could be doing. Wehave three kids. I could not sit around all day and watch a murdertrial on ~TV, especially with my kids around.

Mohammed : Ah, this is Mohammed, calling from New York. Jean : Mohammed, calling from New York. Glad to meet you.  Well, the topic isinteresting, but they've been having this one for three days. I don'tknow why they're so obsessed with it. Mohammed : Seems like it's a weekend,  or they want to get as much as they canfeedback from people. Jean : I guess so, Yes. Mohammed : And so what do you think was- Jean : I I didn't actually -- watch the trial very much, uh th- in fact, Ididn't watch the trial at all. Mohammed : Mhm. Jean : I read about it in the newspaper and things like that.  Um,  I dothink from all the, uh, things that I have heard that he -- had to beguilty with all the evidence that they had, but um,  I don't reallyknow why, uh,  if everybody was so, sort of, obsessed about it whenwe've got so much other -- things going on in the world that, uh, seemto me much more important, but um.  Perhaps it was because he seemed,uh, a very human kind of person and, and you cou- you couldn't reallyunderstand why he would want to do something about that. I- I thinkhis motive must have been to be with his new girlfriend, but uh- -- killhis own first child that way is extraordinary.  What do you think?Mohamed? Mohammed : Yeah. Jean : And what do you- What do you think about it? Mohammed : Being very frankly, I was not,  uh, following the case at all even uhuh television, or uh reading, but from what I can observe,that itseems, eh, it has been talking -- -- taking too long time.  Like oneyear almost, now.  It was- Jean : When you what? Mohammed : It was -- taking so much time. Long time. Jean : Yes. Mohammed : The case is almost one year.  Like last,  uh, Christmas if I'm not,uh, recalling my memory.  So for one year, it's really a good time.Hu- So I'm asking myself why it took such a long Jean : Hm. Mohammed : It may be because -- it's quite important,  or so there is so manyeverything's, I mean,  it's, it's a really different case.  But,  thequo- the nice quotient is about the media.  But the media have biasedin this, Jean : Yes. Mohammed : or not?  I believe that media is a very good, uh,  I mean, uh,  wayto give us all the opportunity to understand and see.  I mean withoutthe media,  you and I, how we will be knowing? Jean : No, exactly.  Do you think they were biased in in -- favor of him, or infavor Mohammed : I- -- No, I don't think so. Jean : No, I didn't think so either from what I heard. Mohammed : Maybe -- sometimes in- in- in- in other issues they- they may be biased,but in this issue they were just -- covering what's happening, Jean : Yes. Mohammed : and, uh, they give us the picture. It was a camera -- to give you theview.  I don't think they were biased in this case here. Jean : Yes.  No. Mohammed : And, uh,  what do you think will happen next? Jean : Well, uh they're coming up to the sentencing, and I heard yesterday orread in the newspaper or something that his brother -- I guess it wason the television.  In the news, his brother was appealing -- for themto to sentence him to -- to prison for life rather than the deathpenalty, because -- he said he's a very good listener and he cares aboutpeople, and and he might be able to help a lot of people in prison.  Idon't know whether that is true or not. I know that he had done a lotof volunteer things before, and that was the one things that made mewonder there was any possible chance that it could have been somebodyelse who did it.  I think given such as I have heard, even though likeyou, I did not follow the case day by day or anything like that,  Idon't quite see how he could not be guilty if they've got so much thatappears to point to him.  And what would be the motive for anybodytrying to -- to get him if it wasn't Mohammed : Yeah.

Do you think Arafat's death will help orhurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process?  Was Arafat a good leader?What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafathas died? What, if anything, should the US do to be involved in theMiddle East peace process? Gandhi : Hi, good evening. Marco : Hi. Wha- I didn't catch your name. What's your name? Gandhi : Gandhi from New York. You? Marco : Gindhi? Gandhi : New York. Yeah. Marco : From New York. Gandhi : Yeah. Marco : Uh, Marco from Illinois. Gandhi : Okay, Mark. Uh,  I think it's fresh topic for tonight. Marco : Yeah, yeah. Good topic. It's a good topic. Gandhi : So what do you think? Marco : Well,  um, I would- I would have to start- -- I would have to start,generally, in stating- -- stating what I think is the problem and -- -withthe Middle East and what- For me, one of the major problems is thefact that -- the -- United States government gives so much aid to thestate of Israel.  In which,  the state of Israel buys -- many expensivemilitary weapons,  ah, which is used to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot ofPalestinians.  So, for me, that's -- the- that's essentially the root ofthe problem.  And, um, Yasser Arafat was kind of in a difficultposition, because you have these,  um, incredibly -- oppressed and insome ways imprisoned,  uh, Palestinians,  and if -- Arafat hadn't, um,tried to stand up -- and help them and- and fight for their rights,then -- m- they wouldn't have respected Arafat,  but then again, youknow, he couldn't be too friendly with the West,  um,  and, um, andso he did the best he could, I think. It's a difficult -- leadershiprole. Gandhi : Mhm. Marco : Yeah.  Um,  what do- Well, how about you? Gandhi : I think,  yeah, more or less, I c- I agree with what you said. It'salmost, this is my view as well.  And the question is,  what next?  Imean,  some idea -- from Israeli side, they were saying -- he was aproblem,  and if he goes, everything will be quite easy. Marco : Yeah. Gandhi : Fine.  Now he's not in anymore. Marco : Yeah. Gandhi : So, let us wait and see.  Hope.  If he was a problem himself,  hope-uh,  the coming one -- will be in a good -- position to negotiate withthe other side, Israel, and then -- peace can be achieved. Marco : Yeah. Gandhi : Uh,  we have to wait and see, but,  uh,  it seems it's not easy. Marco : But, I,  eh, I get the feeling that- -- It's almost- -- The peace process-We can't put it on -- the ro- or the- -- the whole responsibility of thepre- -- peace process can't be the leader of -- a- -- a group that is- -- Idon't know, in my view,  has -- not ver- not very many resources tofight- -- to fight this -- battle that -- their trying to fight against -- agovernment that has taken away a lot of their land,  that,  you know,doesn't allow them to really move around in their own country.  So,unless that -- stops,  the, um,  the leader of the Palestinians -- reallycan't do too much -- to further the peace process, because -- there are -- alot of bad things happening to the people -- of that -- leader. Gandhi : That's correct, as well. Marco : Yeah, so it's- -- it's kind of, it's- -- it seems like the, um,  themedia, at least in the United States, is -- putting all of this -- focusand responsibility on the leader of the Palestinians, as if it was Gandhi :  Marco : Arafat's fault that any of- -- any of the violence was caused.  So,  itseems like an unfair treatment -- of- -- of,  you know, the leader of -- thePalestinian people.  Um,  yeah. Gandhi : Yes. That's absolutely correct. Yeah. Marco : Yeah.  Hm. Gandhi : Actually, it- it's a good topic to be choosing, I mean,  uh, becauseit's one of the fresh topics. Marco : Yeah. Gandhi : How long have you been with the study? Marco : Uh, this is probably my tenth or eleventh conversation. Gandhi : Tenth, eleven. Almost the same like me. So, the other -- days, which onewas quite interesting to you? Marco : Um,  well, there's been a couple where -- they've- they talked about theCabinet -- for -- Bush, and Bush has been,  um,  you know,  selecting newCabinet members and -- all of the new members are people that I'm- Idon't really know very well.  So, there's been some topics where I'm-I didn't have very much information.  Other topics -- you know, usuallyabout the election that- -- that, um,  I did have -- a lot of things,  um,to say.  Yeah.  Are you- are you, um,  are you from the United States,or do you come from, uh- Gandhi : I came from the area, I'm from Egypt. Marco : You're from Egypt. Gandhi : Yeah, so I'm- I'm quite, uh, Marco : So you- Gandhi : -cerned about, uh- -- uh, over there I mean.  People, actually, they arewaiting -- to, uh, to see peace is a fact.  Actually, in both sides, Marco : Yeah.

Let's talk about Arafat. What do you think? Ben : Huh.  What do I think?  Um,  well,  when -- around the time he was hewas getting the Nobel Peace Prize and stuff,  I think he got that. Sue : Yes, he did. Ben : Um,  there was a show here in New York at a big theater. I think maybeit was at Lincoln Center in the Philharmonic Theater or theMetropolitan Opera House or the New York State Theater or something.And Arafat came in and got a standing ovation, you know, a peace prizewinner bah bah bah bah bah.  The mayor of New York, who was thenRudolph Giuliani,  stood up and walked out, he was also in attendance,and his, uh, comment to the press afterwards was that, you know, hejust didn't want to honor a terrorist, and I -- one of the few thingsthat I was happy about with Giuliani when he was mayor. Sue : Mhm. Ben : Uh, Giuliani got very popular later because of the- the Sue : Nine eleven. Ben : World Trade Center thing but he- he wasn't so popular as a mayor. Sue : Yeah.  Right, I knew that. Ben : But, you know, I- I kind of agreed with that Arafat thing, though.  I-- but I do think he accomplished something in that the Palestinianpeople do have a legitimate grievance and he put it on the map, youknow. Sue : Well, he- -- he did but I think he really failed miserably,  in myopinion, when he,  um,  refused to sign that treaty that wasoriginally set up because it was a wonderful -- option and it reallycould've re- done some wonderful things for his people and I think hereally did them a disservice by not taking care of it at that time. Ben : Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, what was the treaty? I'm not familiar with it. Sue : Well, um, where they were going to, uh, give them, like, ninety-sixpercent of the Ga- of- of Gaza and he said that he wanted all hundredpercent.  And so he refused to sign it. It was just an- an incrediblefaux pas on his part, from my opinion. Ben : Oh.  Yeah. Yeah, y- it's- it's -- you have to sometimes take a littlebit less than you want, you know, uh,  an- and ninety-six percent is abig percentage, you know. Sue : Yes. And I think that could have really done some wonderful uh stepsfor -- uh for the Palestinian people uh as a whole.  And I felt -- verysad that, um, that that wasn't -- done. It really should've been. Um, itwas really quite unfortunate that- that he -- that he was not willingto,  um, step forward -- to do- do what was really in the best interestsof his people. Ben : Sometimes- sometimes I th- I think it's hard when- when you're the-the first leader, or the George Washington of something, to see thingsother than in black and white.  You know, or maybe he didn't have thegift of- of nuance that would've helped him to- -- to take that rightstep, uh, you know, the- -- the -- his people suffer so terribly andmaybe, you know, it could have been better if he had signed that, huh. Sue : I really think so. I really, truly do and now it's a- a situationwhere, with his passing, um, I think there's a real, um, new opening,a new possibility for- -- some extremely positive steps to come forwardout of this -- I do think that the United States -- will probably berequested to be involved in the negotiation process and I understandthat, I me- uh, because,  um, I think -- both sides -- have a trust in theUnited States that make it- Ben : And we've ha- we have a history, uh, Clinton and Carter w- worked overthere -- -try to get some peace going.

And stuff, and uh -- That's why we should bethere but I'm I'm kind of scared of the people -- that represent theUnited States now, you know. They're not quite the same caliber.

Rainia : Yeah, go right ahead. Paul : Well,  um,  Yasser Arafat was -- was he a good leader?  I I think -- that,uh,  he -- he's -- pretty much -- -- or he was pretty much -- following whathe had always done, even as a young man,  uh, back in Algeria -- when-when he led the -- terrorist attacks against the French to kick them outof -- Algeria.  And I- I think he was doing the same thing there inPalestine.  I- I don't think,  eh,  I don't think he really knew howto,  uh, take on the role of- of peacemaker.

Rainia : Yeah, there're -- th- well,  the way I see it, eh, Bush, eh,  has aright -- wing Christian, right-wing agenda.  He he's -- some -- how thinksthat -- if Israel has -- -- I'm not sure that all -- their prophecies are-- but there's something about -- if -- they can -- get rid of thePalestinians, that will somehow,  um,  their prophecy -- coming true andth- and then -- somehow -- I don't -- I- we don't -- understand what onEarth they're Paul : That sounds -- Rainia : trying to achieve with this but i- it seems like a- Paul : that sounds kind of scary. Rainia : a Christian agenda, yeah, that that -- that, uh, the end of the world,the end times -- if, um,  Israel takes over -- Palestine that's h- some --has something to do with the end times. It's really -- frightening theway they talk -- and, um,  I don't think he's qualified to be involvedin this at all.  It never was right to begin with n- and,  you know,we- we're- we're only given certain information and Paul : Mhm. Rainia : hard to really know the whole -- real story of what's going on overthere. But I do know Paul : Right. Rainia : that what the Israelis are doing is wrong.  By going into theirterritory and building these walls or building settlements -- pushingthe Palestinians out and -- Palestinians -- fight -- with rocks and -- sticksand -- Israelis have their machine guns and bulldozers and -- I just -- t-really unpalatable that the -- whole idea, the -- the way they're goingabout -- this thing and -- I don't really feel qualified -- to say how itshould be, but -- I -- see it -- being wrong to -- hurt children and -- innocentpeople.  No matter what side they're on Paul : Right.

===========Input:  prompt : 5. Death of Arafat (1) Controversial PLO leader Yasser Arafat died ina Paris hospital last week.  Do you think Arafat's death will help orhurt the Israeli-Palestinian peace process?  Was Arafat a good leader?What do you think US policy should be toward Palestine now that Arafathas died? What, if anything, should the US do to be involved in theMiddle East peace process? Barb : I'm Barb from Indiana. Roger : Okay, I'm Roger from, um,  Atlanta. Barb : Hi.  So, what do you think about -- Arafat?  Was he a h- Roger : Uh, I think that, um,  I bet he wasn't a really good leader.  I thinkthat, um,  that his situation -- -- well, see I got to the -- to- to thelevel of power that he was in -- back in the eighties -- and once he, um,you know, started getting wealthy and started getting known,  thathis agenda ch- uh, changed Barb : Mhm. Roger : but it wasn't actually for peace but was to try to find a way to((send)) the Israelis out of Jerusalem in the areas that they wanted.I really don't think that -- they wanted to coexist. I think that, um,he wanted -- you know, all his people -- all his people wanted tocoexist with the -- Israelis. I think that, um,  his death -- marks abeginning of trying to find somebody that -- really wants peace.  Idon't think that in that area of the, um, world that you couldactually have peace. If you know the Bible well you would know thatthere's always going to be a conflict there.  Um,  I think that, uh,the United States should open up -- their -- doors to -- not help, butsupport any, um, process for peace in the area, though.  I don't thinkthat we should get involved to a level, a point where we're sendingpeople over there and, um, trying to -- help keep the peace or anythinglike that,  um.  There's a lot of stuff that can be done -- by justverbal suppo- -- you know. I think that now he's gone, his family isstill around, and Barb : Yeah. Roger : uh, millions and millions of dollars that he had is still around butthey -- if they bring people in that wasn't involved with his cabinet,n- um,  have different views than him, somebody that gener- genuinelycan accept the fact that the Israel- -- Is- Israelis are there andthey're there to stay -- and, um,  we going to have to find a way tocoexist. If they can find somebody like that, then I think that theyshould f- support him and, um,  and back him up -- in trying to helpdefine -- peace in the area where peace is impossible.  What do youthink about it? Barb : I agree with you. I didn't know that much about it, I wasn't much intopolitics back in the eighties.  I was more,  um,  kind of a -- I was akid on the run from abusive parents back then so that wasn't a,  youknow, one of my topics of interest at the time, it is now.  Um,  I --my roommate, and I still don't know that much about -- I'd love toknow more about politics and I'm trying to learn more,  uh, tells me,you know, he was such a terrible man but, eh, I don't listen toeverything he says.  And I think it -- -- I mean, it would be nice tohave peace over there, but I agree with you, I don't think it's evergoing to happen.  I mean, not the way -- -- not the way they'll -- -- notlike it is here.  And I agree that we shouldn't send people overthere. We've got enough stuff going on with Roger : Yeah. Barb : Iraq and I- and, um,  the -- other -- -- the other guy. Roger : Yeah. Barb : We got way too much going and too much expense, I mean, we we can't,the that's Roger : Yeah. Barb : that would be just putting it over the edge right there.  But I thinkought support, you know, a man that, Roger : Mhm. Barb : like you said, is -- would like to coexist -- with everybody andsomebody that is Roger : Yeah. Barb : peaceful -- and, I don't know, I'd like to learn more about the Bible.My parents never took me to church or anything.  But, um, Roger : Yeah. Barb : I'd like to -- I know that,  you know, there's been problems, a lot ofconflict over there, and it seems like no matter what, Roger : Ah. Barb : just like Iraq ye- eh, we try to go in and get peace and- and how longhas it been and,  I mean, I think Saddam needed to be removed butit's- -- there's just -- s- all these people that are going to follow himno matter what. Roger : Yeah, and, um,  I only know about Yasser Arafat because I, um, studyinternational affairs a little bit -- and I know -- a very little bitabout him because, of course he was a, um, leader for a long time,longer than the age that I am -- old, so, but I- I- I- I've noticed -- onthroughout my studies that -- what he represented to the public -- was --what he represented to the international public -- was not what he wasrepresenting to his people -- and he was representing, um,  peace withthe Israelis and he was representing trying to find ((the whites or))divide the land so that it would be,  um, stop,  um,  uh, war andterrorists in the area.  But I don't think that he had the same imageto- to his people. I think that it was a front -- for him to allow to tobe accepted in an international community, but I think -- that hisultimate plans and goals were to to run the Israelis out -- maybe closerto the Gaza strip, and to re-take Jerusalem -- and other cities nearJerusalem,  and to, uh, uplift his people in a way that -- they couldsay, you know, we conquered the Israelis.  It's a matter of, uh -- Imean, it's more than just land,  it's a, um,  conflict of- -- of,  um,hatred,  uh, and racism, I mean, eh, different types of people, um,they don't like each other, Barb : Yeah.

Mark : how you doing? Ali : I'm fine.  How are you? Mark : Good, good.  Not too bad. Ali : Uh, so let me ask you, do you think Arafat was, uh, a good leader ornot? Mark : Um,  to hi- -- yeah, I- -- I think he did what he thought -- was right forhis people.  I- I- -- I would say he was a good leader -- for- -- for, uh,his people.  And as far as our involvement there, should be as littleas possible.  Just let them do -- what they,  you know, what they'regoing to do -- and we should stay out of it ((just)) as -- much as we can.Uh, this country seems to get involved too much in other people'spolitics.  Should just let them do whatever they're going to do, Ali : Uh, Mark : you know. Ali : mm, by the way I am from Arab origin,  so I also have, uh,  uh, thesame opinion -- like you.  I believe he -- -- in my opinion he- he was agood leader -- and, um,  I believe what,  eh, has to be done -- right nowis to ((apply)) -- the United Nations', uh,  decisions about theconflict between Arab and Israel because there is -- -- there are a lotof,  uh, decisions have been made -- have been made -- and this, uh-For example, one of them was, uh, decision number two forty-two -- andthis was about -- the ha- establishing two- two countries,  one forIsrael and another one for Palestine. Mark : Right. Ali : So, if we -- -- eh, if United States,  Bush,  Israel ((told)) th- thesolution or to, uh,  to make the decision,  eh,  I think this willsolve -- the problem.  The -- unfortunately what happens right now- -- The-- for example, which is -- little bit toward it's- it's interest.  Forexample,  when there was, uh, like,  a -- decision against Iraq,  theUnited States -- went directly -- to Iraq to -- -- for, eh,  uh,  aninvasion -- and -- for -- whatever reasons- -- she even was out, uh,  puttingany attention to the United Nations,  uh, like, uh,  approval.  Shedid wha- what she want.  But, eh,  eh, for Israeli, Palestinianconflict there's a lot of decisions that has to be -- applied but untilnow -- she didn't put any pressure,  eh,  toward ((this and)) and Ibelieve this policy has been, uh,  this kind of policy,  eh,  um,  eh,became more and more during -- eh, during, uh, eh, Bush -- -- PresidentBush time.  For example, before, eh, during Clinton,  I believe atthat time -- Clinton was trying hard -- to solve this problem and Ibelieve at that time, if you remember,  um,  Yasser Arafat -- and, uh,the prime minister of Israel, his name was Barak,  they met togetherin the White House -- and -- they almost came to an agreement -- to solvethis problem -- and during Clinton, eh,  period -- they had, uh, this((Oslo)) a- eh, agreement.  Most of the big problems between the twoparties,  they negotiated everything almost and there is -- therewere, like, final steps that have to be solved.  But, uh, I think ifthere was, like,  the, um,  the same policy has to be followed afterClinton.  I think -- everything would- -- -finished then- -- the -- I thinkUnited States -- went to another direction and, eh,  they forgot aboutthis problem right now. Mark : Yeah, I g- eh, see, I don't, Ali :  Mark : um, when- when policy is set by one -- -- by one president -- towards-towards one thing,  it's usually -- followed through, if there issomething to follow through, by the -- next president in turn. He ismore or less obligated -- to continue,  uh, the process that was alreadystarted -- but -- I think -- Bush's -- agenda -- is not -- towards that right now.That is not his priority, I don't think. Ali : Yeah, I think so, yes. Mark : And, eh,  uh,  although, you know, it's been a long time -- that -- i-they have both -- b- both Israel and Palestine, they both need a -- theyboth need their own country -- and- Ali : That's, uh, true because, uh, Mark : an- -- eh, y- Ali : in the United Nations they have established -- eh, they made thisdecision already. Mark : R- right, right. Ali : The -- uh, there, uh -- there has to be two countries, one of them forPalestine, Mark : Right. Ali : and another one for Israeli but, uh, Mark : I- I- I agree a hundred percent, uh, Ali : because, eh, i- Mark : eh,  but to get so involved in it. I think,  the people,  uh,  thepeople that are in charge, the- eh, the people that run thegovernments there -- do need to sit down an- and- and be in touch witheach other and if they need a mediator or something like that, that- Ali : Which is played by U- United States. This is the mediator which, in myopinion, is the one Mark : R- Ali : who has the power to convince both -- parties -- about- Mark : Right. Right. Um, i- -- they -- in -- Ali :  Mark : it's a -- -- eh, that i- -- that is what is need and un- Ali :  Mark : unfortunately they've been -- they've been trying to get this settledand hashed out for -- twenty-five, thirty years now.

Winnette : Yeah? Irvin : All right. Uh, what do you know about this Scott -- Peterson trial? Idon't know much about it, to be honest with you. Winnette : Oh this is funny because I just, one of my calls the other day wasregarding this. Irvin : Really? Winnette : So uh uh they're act- -- actually that's getting a few differentquestions and -- actually the gentleman I got the other day -- hadn't evenheard about it.  Um, Irvin : Oh really? Winnette : Well um,  I've been following it pretty closely.  Um,  I guess becauseof -- you know it being a mother and -- being pregnant for a baby. Irvin : Oh, uh-huh. Winnette : Um,  kind of hit more to -- I you know to home.  Um,  So you -- how muchof it have you followed? Did, did you -- follow any of it at all when itwas on in the news or in the papers or anything? Irvin : Hardly any of it at all, because -- um -- for one thing -- I do not have a~TV or a radio and I don't get a daily newspaper.  We get Winnette : Oh wow. Irvin : we get a weekly newspaper. Winnette : Okay.  Um,  well I'll I don't get any newspapers at the house, but -- Ilisten to the radio every morning on my way to work and Irvin : Oh yeah? Winnette : and uh -- when it first happened it was -- pretty publicized on everyradio station um -- it come across -- on the news and we keep our ~TV onat my work, because we have a customer waiting area, so Irvin : Oh, uh-huh. Winnette : um actually one of our employees had wa- watched ((happening)) -- sofrom that point on we kind of -- talked a lot about it at work and Irvin : How long ago was it? Winnette : different things.  Um,  it was a year -- almost a year ago.  Over a yearago?  Because it was just before Christmas -- that it happened. Irvin : Over a year ago. Winnette : Yeah.  Um,  I'm thinking -- I don't know, November, December, I'm notsure exactly.  But I know it was just before Christmas -- when they haduh -- it had happened, because she was missing during Christmas and thenthey had found her body.  And they -- they found the baby as well. Irvin : Terrible. Winnette : Um,  so when they found the baby, the baby of course had been -- theydon't know if the baby was born, through delivery,  or -- if maybe fromum -- the corpse I guess Irvin : So the baby was separate. Winnette : maybe extracted it.  Um, actually she was pregnant for the baby. Irvin : But the baby was separate from the body when he found it? Winnette : Yes.  Yep.  Um,  I don't know if ma- I you know I don't know the wholestory for sure, but -- um -- he had -- you know, obviously -- denied that hewas involved anything to do with it. Then they found out that he washaving an affair on her.  And -- then of course when they wereinvestigating him -- he tried running.  Dyed his hair and -- grew out amustache and -- they caught him trying to run with -- quite a bit of cash. Irvin : Wow. Winnette : So I mean, Irvin : (()) Winnette : he's -- in all honesty been guilty all along the way but Irvin : Uh-huh. Winnette : of course you know they've got to give him that reasonable doubt. Irvin : Uh-huh.  So is he is he still um -- in prison now? Winnette : Yeah.  And they're making the determination if -- in fact he will getthe death penalty, or life in prison.  So that's what's is up in theair right now. Irvin : What state is this in? Winnette : California. Irvin : It's in California. Winnette : And -- um -- I know I had, it was supposed to have be deliberated on -- thetwenty-second of November,  but they had an issue happen with -- one ofthe jurors -- so it's postponed everything.  But,  actually they weretrying to pass a law, and I don't know if it ever did take intoeffect,  that if in fact a mother was killed, and pregnant,  um -- forthere to be a double murder charge. Irvin : Oh, uh-huh. Winnette : And -- they were in fact trying to enforce the death penalty on thatcharge if they were -- found guilty on both charges. Irvin : Uh-huh. Winnette : And -- so it's kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he gotfirst degree murder and -- um and then got manslaughter on the baby.  Sohe didn't get both first degree murders. Irvin : What's the difference? Winnette : Where -- Um,  I guess because he didn't murder the baby directly. Irvin : Oh. Winnette : I'm thinking maybe was the difference.  And because of the the chargeon the baby, they couldn't automatically give him the death penalty,but -- obviously there's enough -- um, complaints or whatever Irvin : What was his excuse for doing something horrible like that? Winnette : and -- well he still denies everything.  He has never admitted Irvin : ((Still does)) Winnette : to do it.  um -- But the only thing they can figure is that maybe -- hewanted back into the bachelor life, and didn't want to be a father,didn't want to be tied down with a wife and child Irvin : So he didn't have any other children? Winnette : that was -- No, that was going to be their first.  And actually I don'teven think they were married that long, maybe a year or two.

Dave : Yeah, but, uh, just in the last uh, well, actually just in the lastmonth or so I -- is really the only time I've ever heard anybody eveneven talk about it.  And, uh,  well, I I -- I did read a a column todayby,  uh,  a Hispanic fellow and, uh,  he wasn't native born, he wasfrom Cuba,  and, uh,  he stated that, uh,  we he was in the fifthgrade and and, uh,  uh, he was taking -- no, I guess he was in middleschool and he was taking a civics class and and it was pointed out tohim that, you know, he could never become President.  And he stated atthat time, you know, he said, well, okay I can't be President I'llnever, you know, get involved in politics.  So,  you know, he kind ofthought that was unfair. Lynn : Well, you know, in one sense it is but then, I mean -- well, mygrandparents came over, Ellis Island and everything, but when I thinkabout, you know, a foreign person or maybe born in another country andcoming here it doe- it doesn't seem right in one sense for -- for themto be able to be President of this country. Dave : Right. Lynn : But -- it kind of falls like -- I mean I've been on the internet latelyand I've ran across these really weird websites -- and I'm not a fanaticor anything but they're all about the -- the new world, one worldgovernment and things like that, you know,  and to me it's justanother point in that direction. Maybe eventually, you know, Dave : Uh-huh. Lynn : that won't make a you know, twenty or thirty, forty, fifty years downthe road. Dave : Right, eh, so what do you think about George Bush?  Eh, are Lynn : I I think he's a phony. I mean, that's another thing they were talkingabout that he is with the Skull and Bones from I think he went toYale, Dave : Right. Lynn : and so was his father and and Clinton was, too, and and peopleactually that +alumina Dave : And Kerry was a Skull and Bones, also. Lynn : Also, yeah, and then they -- I don't know what else they're called butthey're saying, like, they were like Satan people, Satan worshipersand, Dave : Oh. Lynn : you know, and you don't know what to believe. I watched a show onchannel nine about Bush and him being religious,  spiritual, ofcourse, but also religious when his father wasn't,  and -- I don't know.You know, you hea- I I think it's all a bunch of lies, and -- I I don'tI'm not crazy about Bush. There're some things about him, you know,the fact that he does act spiritual and things like that, I like that,I think that's what got him in office but, Dave : Uh-huh. Lynn : um Dave : Well what do you think of him as a man? Do you think he's, uh, a goodman or do you think he's got -- any good qualities, or Lynn : Uh, I -- you know, I want to say that he probably is but then I look atthe things like where he wants -- the things he's done. I think thatpeople are poorer.  I mean,  I just think the um, we're so much morein debt. I just don't think he -- -- But as far as the man himself, Iagain, I don't know. Dave : Yeah. Lynn : What do you think of him? Dave : Well, I I think I think his dad was a better man than he is.  Youknow,  to me,  you know, I'm kind of in the same boat you're in.  Ithink he was just he's kind of the sizzle, you know, he's not thesteak.  I think he was just sold to the American people.

Obo : Yeah, I guess the elections, ah -- basically, who did you vote for, andthe vice presidential candidates, and why, and I'll be honest with you Ted : Yeah, go ahead. Obo : I didn't vote for either of those. Ted : Oh okay. Obo : I did vote, but I I don't vote for the main party Ted : Uh-huh. Obo : ever, I usually try to stay out of the main party, because I think,and this last election showed that both are very brutal. Ted : It was Obo : Um, yeah I think that the, uh Ted : election. Obo : Oh, I'm sorry. Ted : It was a very brutal election. Obo : Yeah, yeah, it's, yeah, you're absolutely, yeah, and I'm sorry, Imean, if you want to add anything I'm sorry. Ted : No no, go ahead, go ahead. Obo : And, ah -- It's, it's just that -- Like, I I just, I think that the lastfifty years, the government has been mes- messed up by both theseparties, honestly.  Even maybe before that.  So, I, I usually do thirdparty -- um, and the way it was working this year was that the Democratsreally pushed to get Ralph Nader off the ballot Ted : Yeah.  Yeah they did. Obo : in every state, and um -- I mean, the Republicans sort of tried to playlike they were helping him out, but they knew they they didn't reallyhave to because they knew the Democrats were already doing more damageto keep him off the ballot and they were successful, and for aprogressive party that was very brutal. Ted : Mhm, it was. Obo : And I wasn't really impressed by either of the two vice presidentialcandidates, I know Dick Cheney seems to be running the show Ted : You know? Obo : and, ah -- I mean, and, and a lot of it has to do -- and then, I justdidn't know much, John Edwards seemed nice, but he just, you know, hewas just, he just got elected to the Senate,  and,  I wasn't reallyfamiliar too much with hi- I mean, I think it's great that he got intothe vice presidential role, but -- again, it's the whole parties thatI'm really not really I don't like their policies. Ted : Well, you kind of hit on some of my sentiments, um, I'm a fifty-year-old black male,  and this was my first election that I participatedin.  And the reason was was that, ah, I'm retired Air Force -- andbefore, ah, because I was in the military -- ah, didn't didn't reallythink that my vote, um, counted one way or the other, that's that wasmy thinking.  You know, I had a role to fulfill and regardless of howI voted, uh, I was going to have to fulfill that role.  Um, Obo : Yeah. Ted : the, the situation, though, now that I'm out and, in the civiliansector,  um,  I find that the economics as far as home -- is what I'mmost concerned with.  And because of the economic situation, I don'tthink that's being addressed.  Yes, I feel very, very bad in regardsto the, ah, nine-eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff Obo : Mhm. Ted : um, but I think so much attention is being paid to that -- that -- as youmentioned, over the past fifty years, the two parties that run thecountry -- um, have definitely taken a, um -- streamlined approach towhatever their agenda may be and not the will of the people. Obo : You said it very well.  I totally, you coul- I couldn't have said itbetter. Ted : Now it's uh -- and as time goes on, you know, like, ah, what are we,you know, headed for, what are we faced with? Obo : I I Ted : I mean, if we don't start looking inward and start taking care ofthings at home -- uh, right now, yeah, we are the biggest power in theworld.  I heard a commentary by Rush Limbaugh, ah, the other day, andthe comment was made was that there always is going to be a big dog onthe street.  And right now I'm proud to be, ah, you know, behind thebig dog, meaning the United States.  If i- if if -- the United States isnot the big dog,  some power in the world is going to step up and bejust that.  We got so many crises and tension uh what do you -- hotspots in the world,  that, uh,  instead of getting better, it seems tobe growing.  We got, uh, what is it, Iran?  Uh, right behind Iraqthere.  And then North Korea, which is, you know, always volatile.Uh, you know, those situations are not getting any better, you know? Obo : You're absolutely right, yes.

Dan, did you say? Derek : Derek. Marco : Derek. Derek : Yeah. Marco : Hi, nice to meet you. Derek : Yeah, you too. Marco : Um Derek : How's it going? Marco : Good, good.  So, uh the election, um -- the, um -- let's see, overall Ifelt -- ju- just give you a brief -- summary, I felt -- that -- John Kerry andEdwards were were pretty strong candidates and -- uh -- mm, I don't know,I guess just in terms of policy I didn't -- I didn't, uh, find -- that ascompelling as just -- the personality of -- the different candidates. Derek : Yeah. Marco : felt like I could trust Kerry -- uh, little bit more even though he wasmuch more of a politician than Bush. Derek : Mhm.  Mhm. Marco : Uh, he was -- kind of a smooth talker and Derek : Mhm. Marco : Um -- uh -- seems like a politician, they way he presented Derek : Mhm. Marco : his you know his his um argument.  But -- uh -- strangely I felt like thatwhat, that was -- one of -- one of his good qualities because I didn'tfeel Bush was politician enough.  That um -- one of the -- issues that Iwas concerned about was just -- the representation of the United Statesand -- on the international stage Derek : Sure. Marco : and I just -- uh -- I uh -- I don't know, uh, Bush is -- the way he presentsum -- the ~US position -- uh -- seemed a little -- abrasive to me. Derek : Mhm. Marco : And I -- felt like, hm -- if we're trying to, um -- make -- um -- the UnitedStates safer and more stable -- conflict in the world more stable thenwe probably need somebody -- who is a little bit more -- of a politicianin the sense that -- the, they care about diplomacy and -- uh, even thoughwe may not -- give in to -- the will of the other nations present it in anicer way. Derek : Mhm. Marco : Yeah, it seems ((I make)) kind of simplistic, but -- that was -- animportant thing for me.  Uh Derek : Yeah. Marco : Yeah. Derek : Um -- I was a little different. I I I agree with everything you said.  Ijust, um -- I come from a little different background as far as being -- Iwas never into politics and now I I actually have gotten into God muchmore and and, you know, searching spirituality out. Marco : Uh huh. Derek : Generally people like that are conservative, you know, Marco : Yeah. Derek : uh, with their views because of different things like abortion and,and, uh, pro-life and -- all that kind of thing so I came form thatbackground Marco : Uh huh. Derek : eh, but that was just an added bonus for me in the fact that -- I toowas obviously at this point in time concerned about the welfare of oursecurity -- and I felt personally that if -- Kerry was in office we'd kindof be, uh -- up a creek without a paddle because I think -- he is so laidback -- um, and not as aggressive as Bush that at this point in thegame, where we're at -- we're in this thing full full -- steam ahead Marco : Uh huh. Derek : and for a transition to occur at this point -- to someone who is laidback -- and not as aggressive as him I think would actually endanger the~US even more. Marco : Yeah. Derek : I think that the international, uh uh, leaders would look at Kerry andknow, they're very smart, I mean they're -- they're on top of thesethings, they know, you know, it would , it just would have opened agateway. Marco : Uh huh. Derek : I feel Marco : Yeah. Derek : that, uh, it may have actually put us in more danger. At least Bushhas -- pulled out the gun, you know, stick to them, and um -- you know,that's where I was coming from on that. Marco : Yeah. Derek : And then when I Marco : ((Do you think)) Derek : I listen to a lot of talk radio and when I heard the stuff about Kerryback in the -- the the, apparently the scandals he's pulled as far asthe uh, medals when he served time. Marco : Uh huh. Derek : You know, uh -- I listen to a lot of talk radio and spoke with, youknow, heard from a lot of, uh -- veterans -- and they said it wasphysically, uh, impossible for him to achieve what he said he did. Marco : Uh huh.  Uh huh. Derek : And all the meetings he's missing, and just, you know, I think it'smore of a status quo for him. Marco : Yeah. Derek : I think he's more, he got so much money that I think he was justconcerned with attaining this position and a title. Marco : Yeah. Derek : you know ((flag)) for him, so Marco : Do you think, um -- the -- when the Republicans are campaigning -- they weresaying that well, another attack on the U.S. is -- imminent, that itprobably -- probably going to happen -- and -- um -- and -- they even went sofar to say that if -- it's really difficult to prevent something likethis and of course they're doing the best they can and -- I think Kerrywould do the best he could.  But do you think, um -- that -- and thisisn't quite a political issue, but do you think that -- there's going tobe another attack on the ~US?  Uh like in the next five years?Something big like -- the world (()) Derek : I, I don't know what your beliefs are, as far as, uh -- biblically orspiritually or whatever, but -- I believe it's inevitable. I mean, we'regoing down, you know? And, yeah, and this is, all these things havebeen written about actually. Marco : Really?

Didn't they gowith a senior official, I had James : to Ed : didn't think they were going to ask this question, but I James : Oh y- yeah, you're right, they did send someone. Ed : but it wasn't -- like, ah, wasn't Bush, I definitely wouldn't send him,I don't think you want to have him in that part of the world rightnow. James : Right.  No.  No.  No, I don't think Ed : Regardless of what you think about him, he's, ah James : Yeah, I don't think he should have went -- as a matter of fact, I don'tthink any senior official should've went, I don't think -- Secretary ofState Colin Powell should have went.  Uh, whoever they sent was, wasgood enough. Ed : Yeah. James : Yeah, was good enough, just to show -- the Palestinian people -- that, uhyou know, America does care somewhat -- that you've lost your leader.But, uh, no,  it would've been -- it would've been a wro- as a matter offact, I think sending Bush would have made it worse.  You know.  Uh,because he's not liked that much by the Palestinian people.  So I, Idon't think sending him would've been -- would've been the right thingto do. Ed : No, I agree with that.

James : hundreds of years -- and a lot of people have lost their lives, and anda lot of kids have grown up and all they've ever known -- on both sidesIsraeli and Palestinian, all they've ever known is war.  And it's justtiresome.  I mean, that's, that's my, my view, this thing has gone solong -- like you said, about a piece of land.  And it's just, you know,They, they, they got to learn at some point -- that they're going tohave to be able to get along.  Or this is just going to keep goingaround, and around, and around,  and, you know, the the -- thePalestinians will, will, will -- will -- will do something, then Israelwill respond, and then back and forth -- and it's just like a neverending circle. Ed : Oh yeah. James : It's like a never ending circle of violence and death and destruction.And, like I said, I'm personally just tired of it.  I think the worldis just tired of it. Ed : Oh yeah.

You thinkit was poison? Paul : Well -- ((smoosh)) no, I I heard that just a couple of days ago and -- I Ikind of doubt it or at least I hope not. I guess that's what it is. Mike : Yeah, I don't think he was poisoned.  I think he was just fr- frailand I think he'd been uh, he'd been looking frail and he was shaky. Paul : Yeah. Mike : You know, he'd been looking h- like he was shaking and, uh,  seemingfrail.  For some time when I'd see him in public, uh, Paul : Yeah, that's true. Mike : presentation -- so forth. Paul : Right. Mike : And I think it whatever it was, it got him, just caught up with himand and he reached the you know, the end of his time. Paul : Yeah. Mike : So,  that's about it on that, I guess. Paul : Yeah.  Well, I I guess now that that he's he's died -- it'll be, uh,  orit it should be a change for the ~PLO Mike : Well, yeah, it'll be change. I I don't know if it'll move forward anybetter -- but, uh, this, uh,  I've heard our administration thinks itwill. I think he was a block to the peace -- but I think it's not onlyhis doing, it's also the -- you know, the, uh, more, uh, drasticelements of the ~PLO that, uh,  that, uh, wouldn't allow him to pursuepeace Paul : Right. Mike : at any cost. Paul : Well, I'm -- I'm -- I don't know, uh.  He he seems like a guy who is muchmore comfortable -- being under siege than in negotiating peacesettlements. Mike : Uh-huh. Paul : Um, I Mike : Yeah. Paul : maybe that Mike : Well, you know, he was kind of damned if he did and damned if hedidn't. Paul : Yeah.  Well Mike : You know, if he if he made peace he had factions of his own peoplethat would've killed him -- and if he didn't make peace, eh, then he'sconsidered, you know, the the warmongering, uh, man who won't makepeace, you know.  So, he, uh, he couldn't really win. I don't think hecould make peace.  I don't know if anyone else can, either. Paul : Yeah, I guess that's the big question, if someone moderate takes overand they reach a settlement,  does that mean the ~PLO will split?  Imean that -- that could be just -- dangerous. Mike : Yeah. Paul : I guess, uh, making peace with half of the Palestinians is better thannothing. Mike : One of the other questions it asked us was, did we think our presidentand our, uh, you know, officials should've attended his funeral. Paul : ((Oh, I b-)) Mike : What do you think about that? Paul : Yeah.  Well, I I don't remember who they sent, but they did send oversome very -- low level state department person Mike : Oh, I see. Paul : and, uh, Mike : I didn't know that. Paul : I I -- I was kind of embarrassed about that. Mike : That we did or d- that we did not send our officials. Paul : I mean -- We -- we did,  but i- it was some -- it was a nobody, basically. Mike : So you were embarrassed because you thought they should've sentsomeone higher up? Paul : Yeah. Mike : Oh, I see. Paul : I I -- I mean, for for the funeral ceremony in,  uh, Egypt.  ((I mean)) Mike : Yeah, I think so, too. I think they should've sent someone higher up. Paul : And, uh, I I can understand that they wouldn't want to send anybody Mike : ((that he)) -- Don't forget this was the this was the representative ofa whole people, you know what I mean? Paul : Yeah. Mike : The past he was their main representative and, uh, just out of respectfor the people we should've sent someone I think. Paul : Hm.  Bad bad or good.  Yeah, I think it would've been a much morepositive message. Mike : Yeah. Paul : ((We realized that)) Mike : I think it would've, uh, you know, been a -- a step toward, um, youknow, gaining the, uh,  I don't know, the respect and and the, um, Paul : Right.  Yeah, I think that Mike : uh, th- of the people that we're going to have to be working with totry to bring about a peace, you know. Paul : that ((yeah,)) it -- Yeah. Mike : And, uh,  it would've -- gone an- a little farther to encourage them to,you know, be willing to sit down at the table with us, at least, youknow. Paul : That's true. Mike : And, I mean not that it would've even been noticed -- in that regard hadhe -- had had our president or someone higher gone, but the fact thatthey didn't, that's what's really going to be noticed, you know what Imean? Paul : Yeah.  Well, uh, you know,  Colin Powell is a -- pretty moderate guy andwould've been nice to see him there or maybe -- the, uh,  Deputy -- Secretof State. Mike : Uh-huh. Paul : I'm not even sure who that is.  Eh,  somebody will -- or higher up. Mike : Yeah, someone m- a little more, uh Paul : Some flunky bureaucrat. Mike : yeah.  Yeah, it didn't seem quite appropriate. Paul : But, uh, at at least for the ceremony in Egypt I think, uh,  I canunderstand that no one would want to go into -- Palestinian territory. Imean,  they it was total chaos there. Mike : Uh-huh.  Sure.  Yeah.

Marco : Well, I'm think- Mike : How about you start. Marco : Yeah, okay, um, ((lot of question)) -- and, um,  I- I don't think it waspoisoning, even though I haven't read -- a lot of articles about it. Ithink- Mike : He- he was old. I mean- Marco : Y- he was old, yeah.  And- -- and that- I- I didn't realize he wasn'tallowed to be buried in Jerusalem, which- Mike : Yeah, but a lot of that has to do with things that he's done. Marco : Yeah. Mike : He's- I mean, like, you know, let's- i- -- for- for all he did in hislater years, eh, Yasser Arafat was responsible for -- a good chunk ofal- you know, a lot of -- Israeli dying -- i- you know.  He basically, eh,i- I'm completely torn on the whole thing. I mean, on one hand -- Ithink it was kind of wrong that -- that -- you know, the ~UN just kind ofwent in and said, hey, you know, guess what?  You know, we're- we'reyou know, this is Israel now, state of Israel.  And basically whatthey did was they carved up the region and- -- without any regard to,you know, tribal -- animosity really, is really what it boils down to, Marco : Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. Mike : um.  You know, then it th- it was there,  he had to try to maintainthe status quo -- but they bred -- people like Yasser Arafat, I mean,  ifit -- if it wasn't for the stupidity of the United Nations,  people likeYasser Yara- Arafat w- probably would've never even gotten off theground,  you know. Marco : How how did the United Nations, uh,  Arafat in power, or help? Mike : Well, in other words eh, in other -- when -- after World War Two when theywhen -- basically the state of Israel was formed Marco : Mhm. Mike : in f- uh, nineteen forty eight, I think it was. Marco : Yeah. Mike : Um,  you know, you- e- -- granted, you know, there were there wereJewish people already living there,  but -- all the Jewish peoplestarted going there and they j- basically just- you know, they justtook over.  And- and Marco : Yeah. Mike : in in a region where,  uh, you know,  y- you know, we live in America.It's like coup- you know, f- our country's a couple hundred years old,we got a couple of gripes going back to, you know, what, seventeenseventy six, Marco : Yeah. Mike : there it goes,  you know, thous- it's like the Hatfields and theMcCoys. They're fi- they don't even know why they're fighting anymore.They just they hate each other -- and they're always going to hate eachother -- and it doesn't matter who started it,  but -- i- you know,somebody eh, th- somebody's in always intent on winning.  And it's andit's it's you know,  a war of attrition. Nobody wins. It's either,you know,  you may kill me, but I'm going to kill all of you before-y- you know what I mean? It's just i- i- it's stupid. The wholething's stupid. And a guy like Yasser Arafat, Marco : Yeah.  Yeah. Mike : he was a terrorist.  In in the sixties -- in the mid sixties an- and anda- you know, on into- -- you know, through the mid eighties -- the guy wasa terrorist. Marco : So, let us let us not forget that when Israel was -- formed -- and theywere,  um,  the -- the Israelis for not feeling -- like they had alegitimate -- right -- some of the land or that -- land wasn't, um,rightfully theirs. There were -- two very strong -- militant groups thatwere Israeli and they -- committed a lot of terrorist acts, Mike : Oh, the yeah, the Zionists. Abso- absolutely. Marco : much -- Yeah.  So, I mean, i- -- you know,  uh, how we consider -- Arafat aterrorist,  we also should consider that -- could've been, in some ways,a reaction to some of the terrorism that was -- initially -- committed bythe Israelis. Mike : Absolutely. I'm not believe me, I'm not I'm not excusing -- anybody -- butfor the purpose I I mean, the way I see it is you know, I guess forthe purposes of the conversation th- -- that they want to hear, Marco : Yeah. Mike : y- you got to kind of have to put that as y- -- i- it's kind of like -- doif that's the case, do two wrongs really make a right?  You know whatI mean? Marco : But if Arafat hadn't been I don't know if he's -- directly -- been linkedto Hamas' acts,  uh,  but he was put in a -- pretty -- sticky situationhaving to negotiate -- the militants of -- Palestine -- the internationalleaders -- and if it if Hara- Arafat hadn't -- somehow appeased -- theHamas groups or the Palestinian militants,  then -- he would've beenkicked out,  overthrown -- by- -- by the Palestinians. Mike : Oh, forget about kicked out or overthrown, he would've been killed.That's-that's how it works over there. Marco : Yeah. Yeah.  Exactly.  Well, it it's not really Arafat -- as anindividual, I think it's just -- whatever leader -- is -- placed in theposition of- Mike : He was he was basically -- I mean, I've read I've read articles an- and-and- and -- stories that basically have linked him to the to the to theMunich -- massacre -- th- you know, the Munich Olympic massacre th- theIs- the Israeli team. It- -- the the problem is -- what he did -- back wayback when Marco : Uh-huh. Mike : will -- f- forever tarnish anything that he did -- in his later years.Like like you said, bringing the groups together but the reason thathe was able to bring them together is because he was once one of them.

Joe : So, uh, what do you think about Arafat? James : Well -- I, uh, I don't think there was anything malicious, uh, in termsof his death -- uh, just looking at him these last, uh, couple of yearsuh, it seems like he had Alzheimer's or something. Joe : Yeah, he has been getting older. James : Yeah, because he was quivering at the mouth and and hands wereshaking.  And -- I would imagine that living in that compound couldn'thave been that conducive to his health. Joe : Yeah, he probably should have been in a hospital or a hospice or James : Right. Joe : you know, if it was that bad. James : Right.  Right, I'm sure that they, I don't know about, bout -- the uhsanitary conditions there, but -- I I just don't think it could havebeen, uh, conducive to his health.  And as far as, uh, Israel, uh,allowing -- him to be buried -- uh, in Jerusalem Joe : That's accept James : huh? Joe : That's acceptable to me. I mean James : Well, it, it's acceptable to me, but I don't think it was feasible. Joe : feasible James : Yeah, given the circumstance in that area right now.  I don't evenknow if they would have been able to pull it off,  you know? Joe : Well, uh, so he, in fact he wasn't James : Pardon me? Joe : so, um -- no, so he wasn't buried in Jerusalem. James : No.  No, they buried him -- uh, inside that compound. Joe : Oh, I see. James : Yeah, they buried him inside that compound.  But like you say, Idon't, I don't -- I personally -- uh -- wouldn't have seen a problem withit, but -- I just don't think it was feasible. I don't, I don't thinkthat they would have been -- uh, secure enough to really do it.  I don'tthink either side would have really -- let it happen -- and -- and as far asa senior U.S. official going, I don't think that would have beennecessary either. Um, I know President Bush shouldn't have went -- andhe wasn't going. Joe : Well, I kind of feel, I kind of feel another way. I think a seniorU.S. service in there, should have been there, because I mean -- he,Arafat's been -- been the one coming to all these peace talks, you know,with President Clinton and, you know, other James : Mhm. Joe : other um -- litigations towards that. James : Mhm. Joe : You know, I think, I think we could have just showed our face and saidyou know, yeah, we do recognize this man. James : Mhm.  Well it, they sent someone.  I don't know who it was -- ((Itwasn't)) Joe : It probably, it wasn't anybody important. It was just like a James : Yeah it was an under secretary, there's no doubt about it. There wasno senior Joe :  James : there was no senior U.S. official there.  There's there's no questionabout that. Joe : Yeah. James : But, uh -- you know, uh, Bush's policy -- towards, uh, Yasser Arafat hasbeen hands off Joe : Yeah. James : from from the beginning cause I don't, I don't think he ever even metwith him. Did he? Joe : I don't think so. I don't think so. James : Yeah, I I Joe : Bush is kind of like, staying away from the whole Israel -- Palestinian James : Mhm.  Now on his part I think that was a mistake. Joe : Yeah. James : Yeah, you know you got to engage people in some type of dialogue Joe : And James : if you Joe : to me, the talk, the peace talks should have continued -- afterClinton's administration left. James : True. Joe : Cause at the cause at the end Clinton was doing all this peace talkwith Arafat and, um James : True.  Mhm. Joe : ((forget)) the um, prime minister in Israel, but he was talking tohim. James : Uh, Sharon. Joe : Sharon, yeah. James : Yeah.  Mhm. Joe : They were doing all these talks in Camp David and and it should havejust continued when Br- Bush came into office. James : You're absolutely right. I agree. Like I said, I think that was one ofBush's biggest mistakes, Joe : Mhm. James : not continuing -- the talks.  Because Clinton had came so very close Joe : Yes. James : to to maybe getting some type of agreement Joe : No. James : but, uh, Bush just took a hands off approach. He just -- kind of took ahands off approach. Joe : And now the situation in, you know, Jerusalem and the West Bank isjust -- escalated. James : Absolutely.  And I think too -- Israel's -- position toward Arafat -- interms of keeping him sort of like -- uh -- surrounded in that compound -- Idon't think that was a good idea. Joe : No. James : You know, because that, you can't pick a leader for a people.  Whetheryou like them or not -- people get to choose who they want to follow, Joe : Exactly. James : and the Palestinians had made it clear -- that Arafat was their leader. Joe : Exactly. James : So, I think that they, we should have found a way -- Israel should havefound a way -- to -- keep some type of dialogue -- going along.  Cause uh, Imean, you look at what's going on now. Joe : Mhm. James : I mean, their policy toward him didn't get them anything.  And thenyou got suicide bombing on the one side, and then you got Israel -- youknow, it's like one day, you'll he- a bomb will go off, the next dayIsrael will do and air strike and -- you know, it's like going around ina circle. Joe : Yeah. James : It's like going around in a circle. Joe : It's really a bad situation. James : It is.  It is, and it's, it's been so long -- going on, I mean, you'retalking about something that's been going on historically for hundredsof years. Joe : Hundreds of years and then, it just recently really come intospectrum, James : Mhm. Joe : what, nineteen forty nine? James : Mhm.  Mhm. Joe : When um -- the Israel state -- came into being, or whatever. James : Right.  Right.

Yeah, we're going to be doing, uh,  the typical.  Go up andcelebrate with the family and -- be with the little kids.  You know, the((tough years)) and that which makes it -- because when you get olderit's kind of,  I've got all the gifts, I don't need that. What Ireally want to do is see somebody else enjoy it and the little kidsenjoy it.  So- -- and, uh, do a lot of parties with family -- and friends. Jane : Well, that's kind of where- we're in between which family we're goingto see and when and how and get all that worked out. Ed : Uh, Jane :  Ed : so whoev- yeah, I've seen them- -- just not the gifts it comes down tothe food. See, now you (()). Jane : There you go.  I- one of these choices is meat cooking. We'll have toput that towards the end. Ed : ((Ah, oui.)) -- Eh, ((nice)).  So we- we've only- Jane :  Ed : my family's, uh,  parents are deceased and most of ((them)) is, uh,passed my brothers all over, so her family's still younger -- and, uh,you know, just the odd sides. She's the oldest and I'm the youngest,so she's got younger which -- keeps the thing going, so I- -- you know, myview is -- ((stay)) with the family go visit the family. That's all yougot.  So -- keep it together through thick and thin and -- when it comesto Thanksgiving we go up there and we celebrate.  And then there'slittle parties.  Big- uh, her sister does a big family party -- but tryto keep that same Jane :  Ed : local family coming together.  It's amazing how they can get intolittle squabbles and who doesn't show up Jane : Of course. Ed : like that. I think it's crazy.  So, ((so, uh))- Jane : They used to always really all get together. but his parents uh theyactually live next door to us. but they're starting to get up in theyears, so they're not,  you know, hosting the big parties, so it'sfunny how now people don't all bother to come Ed : Yeah. Jane : and you kind of wonder you know in the next couple of years what's allgoing to happen. Are they all going to see each other. Ed : Yeah, no that's- that's exactly. I've already seen,  you know, ((in))my parents ((' bed)) until they ((got)) less and less that thebrothers got together -- and then now when there's an event you try todo it.  At Christmas it's just impossible because we leave -- two daysafter Christmas Jane : Mhm. Ed : to go out of the country as part of our New Year's Jane :  Ed : celebration. So, for us it's, you know, got to be a quick trip up Jane :  Ed : to her family and then back where we- -- we've been invited to be downin Jane :  Ed : another country. If a person is not- even though it's cold up in theNortheast, it's a family tradition. I should do it -- and less for thegifts and more for Jane :  Ed : being together.  Yeah. Jane : Well, we did- -- -for the kids you know we made it pretty cl- Ed : I don't know, I think that's great.

Not as a negative but as a- Jane :  Ed : you know, we do a lot of traveling so that's going to be- I thinkthat's going to come up. Jane :  Ed : But- -- but for now we're still trying to do- Jane :  Ed : as long as the mother's around,  we'll still do Christmas and act as- Jane :  Ed : she is not really old, but she's getting older, so I think that's onereason to stay together Jane :  Ed : and also I think i- is Jane :  Ed : eh, we- we kind of -- infused a little family party that her sister hasso -- I think if we were to go away both of those might fall off alittle bit and it doesn't take but one year and then all of the suddeneverybody's Jane : Yeah. Ed : not coming to it anymore and it's like a- Jane : That's it. That's the way it is.

Um, Christmas,  not Hanukkah or anything likethat. Deirdre : Uh-huh, so yo- you have a church service? Ryan : Um, actually, usually we're out of town so we don't attend our church. Deirdre : So you go with, um,  family, friends? Ryan : Family, yeah. Deirdre : Family? Ryan : It's almost always my grandma. Deirdre : Your gran- you go to your grandma's house. Ryan : Mhm. Deirdre : Yeah, that's what we do.  Every year,  uh, but I don't always attend.Uh, my family -- celebrates the sun shining. They're always together.So, uh, it's not particularly special at Christmas -- because they seeeach other every other weekend.  But, still,  uh, they go to, uh,grandmother's -- every Christmas.  A particular person's house everyholiday season.  You know, whether it's Christmas or -- Thanksgiving orMother's Day or Easter,  it just alternates it- you know, each- uh, aparticular person's house is- is how they do it. Ryan : Oh. Deirdre : I just don't always attend. Just- -- I don't know, it's- -- there's justso much of my family I can take during one year, you know, but- Ryan : Well, um, since they see each other so much, is there anything thatdoes make it special? Deirdre : Well,  I guess they seem to think it's just special because -- everyonecomes. I- I- it's- -- it's just,  I don't know, old. Y- you know, it's-it's not- -- it's not special to me because they do it all the time. Youknow, special would make it,  I only see you once a year.  It's justnot- it's just not special if I see you every other month. Ryan : Yeah. Deirdre : You know, it's just not. I mean, you know, not like, you're seeingyour mother -- or your sister, maybe your brothers, you know, you- youmight- you may see them all the time,  but when you see your aunts anduncles and all your cousins -- all the time,  where's the break here?But, you know, they like- I don't particularly care for it, but theylike it.  I did attend Thanksgiving and Ryan : Huh. Deirdre : that was nice.  Um,  uh, it was- it was a good day.  Uh, but, youknow, we- we -- spend all day together.  It's not like you just go andeat dinner a couple of hours and go home.  You go and you stay twelvehours -- because most of my relatives live within thirty minutes of eachother, Ryan : ((Ye-)) Deirdre : so it's easy. Ryan : Oh, wow. Deirdre : Yeah.  It's easy just to go to someone's house. Ryan : Well, sounds a lot like my mom's side of the family because they'reall in one city except for Deirdre : And- Ryan : except for her and, uh,  us. Deirdre : Well, would you rather be with everyone else or do you like it -- away. Ryan : I think I would rather be, but then again -- I talk to my cousin and I'malways asking her how my other cousins are doing and -- she hardly knowsbecause she has- hardly sees them every day. Deirdre : Oh. Ryan : So I don't think it'd make a big difference. Deirdre : For you, yeah, well.  I don't ((see them or-)) you know, by choiceand, you know, relatives -- are particular people, you know, but notparticular, peculiar people, let's put it that way.  It's just -- funnyto me who you end up with, you know, Ryan : Yeah. Deirdre : as your relative, you know. You think, eh, you are my rela- you got tobe kidding me. Wh- -- what happened here but, uh, it's fun, uh. Now, I'mnot so big on Christi- I mean, I was- I was raised Christian,  uh,but, uh,  and I didn't put too much, you know, in my house with mykids -- but my daught-, she's just -- you know, she get's into it. She'sreally sentimental. She's gets into the holiday spirit and wantsevery light, you know, in the city on our house and,  you know, treein her room, that kind of thing. Ryan : Yeah. Deirdre : You know, I- I indulge her, you know.  But I don't really get too muchinto it. You know, the- -- all the, um,  trimmings, I suppose,  of theholiday season.  Uh, but I like, you know, gift giving and -- just, uh,sharing things and just having fun. Just,  uh,  just don't over do it.But I would prefer, though, um,  a service, a spiritual service -- touh, family's just always together, they're always together. Now ifthere was a spiritual service then, yeah, see that would be reallyspecial to me.  If everybody- now wh- eh, eh, now years ago, and ofcourse I'm not giving away my age but trust me, I'm older, Ryan : Yeah. Deirdre : eh, I used to, um,  celebrate it with my grandmother -- and we'd alwayshave a midnight service at church.  Now, I enjoyed that.  Gosh thatwas so many years a- Ryan : Wow, a midnight service, like, um, Christmas Eve? Deirdre : Yeah. Yeah. Ryan : Wow.

===========Input: 15 dead as suicide bomber blasts student bus, Israel hits back inGaza HAIFA, Israel, March 5 (AFP) - Fifteen people were killed and morethan 30 wounded Wednesday as a suicide bomber blew himself up on astudent bus in the northern town of Haifa, the first bombing inIsrael in exactly two months.Several hours later, dozens of Israeli tanks advanced into thenorthern Gaza Strip backed by helicopters which fired at least threerockets in the Jabaliya area, Palestinian security sources said.Palestinian medical sources said 60-year-old Mohammed al-Biyari waskilled in his home near Jabaliya refugee camp by the rocket fire andanother wounded.A second rocket landed in farmlands and the other hit a house insidethe refugee camp, but without causing further casualties, Palestiniansecurity sources said.Two 13-year-old children were among those killed in the Haifa busbombing, Israeli public radio said, adding that most of the victimswere youngsters. The army said two soldiers were also among the dead.The bus was ripped to shreds while travelling between a residentialarea and Haifa university. Of the 33 injured still in hospital lateWednesday, two were in intensive care and six others in seriouscondition, the radio said.Israel's night-time raid in Gaza involving around 40 tanks andarmoured vehicles came after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon convened hissecurity cabinet to discuss a response to the bomb attack.Israeli media said the retaliation was unlikely to be on a scale thatwould risk disrupting US preparations for war on Iraq.The Palestinian suicide bomber on the Haifa bus came from thesouthern West Bank town of Hebron, public radio said, naming him as20-year-old Mahmoud Hamadan Salim Qawasmi.Apart from his ID card, also found in the wreckage were the remainsof a letter allegedly outlining his plan to carry out a suicideattack and praising the September 2001 destruction of the World TradeCentre in New York, it said.Israeli police were not immediately available for comment, butPalestinian sources in Hebron said Mahmoud Qawasmi was a 21-year-oldstudent with links to the Islamic radical group Hamas.Israeli forces moved into Hebron's Al-Sheikh district where hisfamily lived and arrested Qawasmi's brother and father after thebombing, they said.Without claiming responsibility, Hamas and another hardline group,Islamic Jihad, said the blast was revenge for a string of bloodyIsraeli army raids into the Gaza Strip in recent weeks.But the Palestinian Authority condemned the attack, saying it woulddivert international sympathy away from the far higher Palestiniancivilian death toll."We condemn all attacks against civilians including today's attack inHaifa," said information minister Yasser Abed Rabbo.The Palestinian leadership said the attack would serve as "a pretextfor Israel's government and occupation army to step up its deadlycampaign which caused the deaths of 77 Palestinians in February".It was the first bomb attack inside Israel since January 5, and camejust days after the hawkish Sharon appointed the most right-winggovernment in Israel's history on a pledge to get tough on security.In the January attack, two Palestinian suicide bombers blewthemselves up in central Tel Aviv, killing 23 other people.Israeli government spokesman Avi Pazner called the latest deadlyblast a "very grave attack" and said the Jewish state would take"vigorous action against the terrorist organisations".He told AFP that Israeli intelligence had been dealing with at least40 tip-offs of impending attacks when the Haifa bus was blown up.US President George W. Bush condemned the "attack on innocents inIsrael," White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, adding that "hismessage to the terrorists is: Their efforts will not be succcessful."He will continue to pursue the path to peace in the Middle East."EU foreign policy supremo Javier Solana likewise slammed the attack,although he also took a jab at Israel, saying, "There have been toomany civilians killed in the last weeks and the last days."In London, a spokesman for the British prime minister said Tony Blair"condemns absolutely what has happened".The spokesman added that he "would obviously call on all sides to dowhat they can to break the cycle of violence, because it is onlythrough engagement that we can realise the vision everyone wants tosee."There needs to be dialogue in order for this to be resolved."The bus attack came just two days after Israeli forces staged abloody raid into a refugee camp in central Gaza targeting a foundingmember of Hamas, which has spearheaded suicide bombings against theJewish state.Hamas vowed to continue its attacks, while the Palestinian Authorityaccused Israel of trying to disrupt top-level Palestinian meetings todiscuss reforms of Arafat's administration.Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erakat said internationalintervention was needed to break the cycle of violence.Eight people, including a pregnant woman and a 13-year-old child werekilled in Monday's Gaza raid, provoking US-led international callsfor Israeli restraint.And on Tuesday, Israeli troops shot dead an elderly Palestinianshepherd outside a Jewish settlement on the edge of Gaza City.In the West Bank, an eight-year-old Palestinian boy as well as hisbrother and a sister were wounded late Wednesday by Israeli gunfirein a village north of the town of Ramallah, their elder sister said.

===========Input: Stalemate at the Security Council; Washington warns it may bypass UN= (PICTURES + GRAPHIC) = UNITED NATIONS, March 14 (AFP)Efforts were to continue at the United Nations Friday to find abreakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on Iraq, with Washingtonwarning it could bypass the Security Council and go to war alone.With marathon talks at the top world body failing late Thursday toreconcile French and Russian opposition to US-British war plans, theUnited States upped its military presence, deploying moremissile-firing warships to the Red Sea.Six non-permanent members of the Security Council considered to be inthe middle ground between the fiercely pro- and anti-war camps, wereworking on new proposals to break the deadlock, France's ambassadorto the UN said."The six are now working on a paper and we will see the outcome ofthat consultation, maybe tomorrow (Friday)" Jean-Marc de La Sablieretold reporters.Iraq was due to present a 30-page report on biological weapons itsaid it destroyed in 1991, according to diplomatic sources inBaghdad, who said a second batch of documents on anthrax would followin the next few days.Amid talk of delaying or even shelving a US-British resolution givingIraqi President Saddam Hussein until Monday to disarm or face war,oil prices in Asia pulled back, shares rose and the US dollar eased.British efforts to provide a way out of the diplomatic mire at theUnited Nations ended without agreement late Thursday, but withLondon's ambassador to the UN, Jeremy Greenstock, saying he expectedtalks to go on into the weekend.His US counterpart, John Negroponte, said: "I can't say we are muchfarther along today than we were yesterday," after hours of talks onsix British benchmarks to test Iraq's compliance with councildemands.The tests were designed to sway six uncommitted council membersbehind a draft resolution which would declare that Iraq has missedits last chance to disarm peacefully unless the council decidesotherwise by Monday.The two allies would not push for a vote Friday on the draftresolution, diplomats at the United Nations said, while US Secretaryof State Colin Powell hinted that Washington would consider not evenputting the text to a vote."We are still talking to the members of the council with respect tocoalescing around a position that wouldn't draw a veto, but theoptions remain: go for a vote and see what members say, or not go fora vote," Powell said."We will be examining them today, tomorrow and into the weekend," hesaid late Thursday.Diplomatic wrangling has centred around the French and Russianrefusal to put their names to any resolution allowing the UnitedStates to unleash its military might against Iraq before weaponsinspections have run their course.France has provoked Washington's ire in its steadfast insistence thatit will veto any resolution paving the way for war, even rejectingthe British proposals for concrete tests before Baghdad had done so.France's threat to cast its veto was only making war more likely,British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said."Unfortunately they appear to have made the decision not to enforce(UN resolution) 1441," Straw told Britain's The Guardian newspaper."That renders it less likely that we get a peaceful outcome."Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Yury Fedotov said the US decision todrop demands for a Security Council vote this week on war with Iraqshowed the resolution had not won enough support.He rejected the British proposals, saying: "The British proposals onIraq are not constructive and do not resolve the key problem, theprevention of a military scenario involving Baghdad," the Interfaxnews agency reported.He repeated that Moscow would not back a resolution that authorisedan attack against Iraq: "It is not necessary now to adopt any newresolution on Iraq, especially resolutions which lead to war."His comments were echoed by the German ambassador to the UN, GunterPleuger, who said: "There is no majority support for the Britishproposal."In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said that weapons inspectorshad to be allowed to continue their work."Together with our friends in France, with Russia, China and themajority of the security council we are confident the disarmament ofIraq can be achieved through peaceful means," Schroeder said.The British-US proposal needs nine votes to pass through the15-member Security Council -- a feat looking increasingly unlikelywith France and Russia vowing to veto the resolution and Syria, Chinaand Germany all opposing.The United States meanwhile deployed its B-2 stealth bombers topositions closer to Iraq and ordered as many as 15 warships capableof firing Tomahawk cruise missiles to the Red Sea from theMediterranean, US officials said.

===========Input: At least 200,000 in US, Canadian anti-war demonstrations = (PICTURES)= ATTENTION - UPDATES, ADDS details /// NEW YORK, March 23 (AFP)Some 70 people were arrested Saturday as demonstrators clashed withpolice at the end of a major peace rally here, as at least 200,000anti-war protesters took to the streets across the United States andCanada.For the most part the marches went off peacefully, but in New York asmall group of protesters were arrested after they refused to go homeat the end of their rally, police sources said.Several police officers were treated for the effects of gas after theensuing clashes -- a result, police said, of the demonstrators usingself-defence devices.Organisers claimed that some 250,000 people attended the rally,creating a human column some three kilometres (1.8 miles) long.Police put the attandance at around 125,000.The city assigned 2,000 police officers to the rally, includingundercover officers who carried beeper-sized radiation detectors andother counter-terrorism equipment.Though opinion polls have shown public support for the war rising inthe United States, opposition to military intervention in Iraq hasgiven rise to an impassioned campaign.Among the sea of banners making its way up Broadway were many signspoking fun at President George W. Bush. "Somewhere in Texas, avillage is missing an idiot," said one sign. "Iraq war: An unelectedextremist vs. an unelected extremist," and "Take the toys away fromjunior."One woman marched topless with the words "shock and awe" daubedacross her back in red ink, a reference to the bombing campaignunleashed Friday on Baghdad.Liana Owen drove 10 hours from Pennsylvania to attend the rally inManhattan with her parents. "It's important that people all over theworld know that we don't believe in the war," she said.Several thousand demonstrators also gathered outside the White Housein Washington, accompanied by a major security presence."They can say they're 'smart bombs,' but smart bombs aren't able todistinguish between military and human targets," Abigail Fletcher, amarcher from Florida, said outside the president's residence.Some of the slogans sought to rebut war supporters' arguments thatthe protests are unpatriotic. "We support our troops -- bring themhome!" read one.A former serviceman, Michael Schmidt of Peoria, Illinois, said: "It'sup to me to help the US -- from here."Others were more blunt, with one banner reading "Shocked, Awed -- andDisgusted."One group, Lesbians Against Boys Invading Anything, carried signssaying "Pre-emptive war is terrorism," "This isn't the USA I love,"and "Where Will the Bombs Fall Next?"Up to 20,000 protesters thronged the plazas and streets of SanFrancisco, where more than 1,600 people were arrested in the past twodays in a civil disobedience campaign.Between 2,500 and 3,000 people picketed the CNN studios in LosAngeles while others at the Atlanta headquarters protested the cablenetwork's coverage of the war for being biased toward the UnitedStates."They make this look like a John Wayne movie," said protester ElvisWoods. "You watch CNN and all you get are explosions and video oftanks and guns. Nobody questions whether this is right or not."Counter-demonstrations in support of the US-led invasion of Iraq tookplace in some cities, with some 2,500 people turning out in Chicago.Flying the US flag and reciting the pledge of allegiance, theyoutnumbered their anti-war counterparts by three to one.Passions ran deep on both sides, but a line of police in riot gearkept them apart. Carrying signs that said, "It's the oil, stupid,"and "Real men don't bomb children," the anti-war protesters wavedblue Earth flags."I agree Saddam is crazy and needs to go, but it's not our place todo it," said Ian Wisniewski, 14, who had a fake bullet hole paintedon his forehead. "It's crazy that we're bombing Iraq. It sickens me."A few yards away, Claire Tortorello, 54, pointed and yelled at theprotesters across the plaza. Holding a framed picture of her son,serving with the Army's 3rd Infantry Division in Iraq, she said shedidn't know whether he was dead or alive."I'm here to support him and others who are fighting for theircountry. They wouldn't be here if it weren't for the freedoms thatothers fought for," she said.Anti-war protests took place around the world Saturday after thestart of the bombing of Baghdad. Hundreds of thousands ofdemonstrators took to the streets in Britain, Spain and Italy, whosegovernments approved of the war.In Montreal, "Stop the War," a coalition of more than 190 groups,said as many as 200,000 people turned out, though police refused togive a figure.Protesters also gathered in their thousands in Halifax, Calgary,Edmonton and Vancouver.Organizers of the civil disobedience campaigns promised to blockintersections and bridges, shackle themselves to lampposts and createhuman cordons to snarl traffic, as long as the war continues.Some 3,000 people have been arrested since the disobedience campaignsbegan last week.

===========Input: Indonesia delays execution of convicts including Indian on death row JAKARTA, March 27 (AFP)Indonesia will delay the execution of six convicts including anIndian on death row after five of them appealed to the Supreme Courtfor a second review, prosecutors said Thursday."If we execute them now we can't bring them to life again shouldtheir appeals for a review be granted," said Antasari Azhar,spokesman for the attorney general's office.The Supreme Court rejected earlier appeals for a case review fromfive of the convicts. The sixth offender has only made one appeal fora review.President Megawati Sukarnoputri has refused clemency for the six andasked for a speedy execution. Five of them are Indonesians convictedof murders while the other is an Indian drug offender, Ayodhya PrasadChaubey."We are talking about someone's life or death so we have to be verycareful," Azhar said.A convict can file a case review or appeal for presidential clemencyonly after the Supreme Court upholds a sentence imposed by a lowercourt.Apart from those convicted of murder, 16 people are on death row fordrug trafficking -- 11 foreigners, four Indonesians and a Dutchcitizen of Chinese-Indonesian origin.Indonesian courts have increasingly handed out severe sentences,including death, for drug smugglers. Narcotics abuse is anincreasingly serious problem in the country.Amnesty International has appealed to Indonesia to spare the lives ofconvicted drug offenders and others, saying there was no proof thedeath penalty deters would-be traffickers more effectively than otherpunishments.Amnesty opposes the death penalty for any crime.Use of the death penalty is rare in Indonesia, where the lastexecution was carried out in May 2001 of two men convicted of amurder in 1989. It was the first execution for five years.A police firing squad enforces the penalty.

===========Input: More US troops to Iraq as Bush, Blair hold war talks = (PICTURES) =ATTENTION - ADDS details /// WASHINGTON, March 27 (AFP)Thousands of fresh US troops headed for Iraq Thursday as BritishPrime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W. Bush discussedthe effort to oust Saddam Hussein, which some senior US militaryofficials warn could last months.About 1,000 soldiers from the US Army's 173rd Airborne Brigadeparachuted into an airfield in a Kurdish-controlled area of northernIraq, establishing a base through which to bring in more troops andtanks, Pentagon officials said.And some 12,000 soldiers from the US Army's 4th Infantry Division,which was supposed to have gone into northern Iraq through Turkey,began flying out of Fort Hood, Texas, Thursday to the region, amilitary fort spokeswoman told AFP.The soldiers are to meet up with ships transporting their equipment,which is arriving in Kuwait from the Mediterranean, where it had beenidling for weeks on navy ships awaiting Turkey's decision.The war in Iraq could last months and require considerable USmilitary reinforcements to assure a victory, the Washington Postreported Thursday, quoting senior US military officials.Sandstorms, dangerously long supply lines and a recalcitrant enemy"has led to a broad reassessment by some top generals of US militaryexpectations and timelines," the Post reports."Tell me how this ends," one senior officer asked the Post.Most US army commanders believe it is critical to pause the breakneckadvance towards Baghdad to secure the supply lines and make sureweapons are operable and troops resupplied after days of powerfulsandstorms and damage inflicted by Iraqi attacks, the Post reports.The Post also quoted Central Intelligence Agency and Pentagonintelligence analysts complaining that Bush officials largely ignoredtheir warning that Iraqi irregular forces would use guerrilla tacticsand offer significant resistance.Publicly US officials have insisted that the war is going accordingto plan, and the most advanced US forces are currently some 100kilometers (60 miles) outside of Baghdad.US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld dismissed worries that therewere insufficient forces in the Gulf region if the battle for Baghdadgoes wrong.After briefing US senators on the war, Rumsfeld told reporters thatthe number of forces "has been increasing and it will continue to doso until it is finished."Meanwhile Blair arrived in Washington late Wednesday for two days oftalks with Bush at the Camp David presidential retreat. Talks were tofocus on how to run a post-Saddam Iraq, with Washington resisting alarge United Nations role.Blair faces an uphill battle to win Bush over to giving the UNoversight of a post-Saddam administration, as Washington officialsare still angry at Germany, Russia, and especially France, over thefailure to secure UN Security Council approval for military action.Blair and Bush were to hold a joint press conference at 1600 GMTThursday.Britain has deployed some 45,000 troops to fight with the more than250,000 US soldiers lined up against Iraqi troops.Bush gave a new, stronger warning that the war could become drawnout."As they approach Baghdad, our fighting units are facing the mostdesperate elements of a doomed regime," Bush told cheering militarypersonnel Wednesday at the Florida headquarters of Central Command,which is running the campaign."We cannot predict the final day of the Iraqi regime, but I canassure you -- and I assure the long-suffering people of Iraq -- therewill be a day of reckoning for the Iraqi regime, and that day isdrawing near," he said.At the last minute, Bush withdrew a phrase in his speech saying thecampaign was "ahead of schedule." A senior administration officialsaid the president had decided to be cautious.Bush pointedly paid tribute to the 48-nation "coalition of thewilling" -- particularly Britain -- that is publicly backing thecampaign.Separately, US Secretary of State Colin Powell emphasized USdetermination to pursue the military campaign despite the diplomaticpressure Washington faces at the United Nations."We are interested in concluding this conflict, not having a pauseright now or stopping right now, but concluding this as quickly aspossible so we can get on with the rebuilding of Iraq and putting inplace a better system of governance," Powell said in an interviewwith the Al-Jazeera Arab television network.Powell, the most moderate member of the Bush cabinet, said he fullyagreed with the president's policy on Iraq and had no plans to leave."Personally, I'm very much in sync with the president and he valuesmy services," he said in an interview with National Public Radio.Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal reported that several British andUS oil companies have quietly advised US and British forces on howoil fields operate so they could safeguard the fields in Iraq.The companies, including Britain's BP PLC and the Texas-based Bootsand Coots International Well Control Inc., were not paid for theirconsultations, but allied military engineers said their advice wascritical.bur-ch/Iraq-war-US

===========Input: Russia hints "peace camp" alliance with Germany and France is dyingby Dmitry Zaks MOSCOW, April 13 (AFP)Russian President Vladimir Putin's summit with the leaders of Germanyand France may have been a failure that proves there can be nolong-term "peace camp" alliance following the end of war in Iraq,government sources were quoted as saying at the weekend."Senior government officials, speaking in the corridors of power inMoscow, have no illusions about any long-term perspectives for the(Russian-German-French) axis," the respected Izvestia daily reported."Sooner or later Iraq will fall and Russia and the United Sates willresume normal relations," the senior Moscow official, who wasreported to be close to Putin, told the paper."The situation in Iraq does not mean that we intend to get into anargument with the United States."The comments indicate that Russia's nuanced position over the war inIraq was becoming ever more scrambled, with Putin pushing to protecthis budding friendship with US President George W. Bush in the faceof strident opposition from the Russian media and other top Kremlinofficials.Analysts have long argued that Putin is far keener to preservefriendly relations with the United States than the pro-European,anti-war camps embedded in much of the Russian media and the foreignand defense ministries.Russia's foreign minister expressed outrage at suggestions from a topWashington official last week that Moscow should forgive the eightbillion dollars in Soviet-era debt that Baghdad owes it, as a gestureof good will.Kommersant business daily joined in, declaring in a furiousfront-page headline: "The United States is demanding that Russia,France and Germany pay for the Iraqi war."And the popular Gazeta.ru news website stormed: "We should haveexpected this!.. This is only the start of a massive US campaign (todecide Iraq's future finances)."Yet Putin has been far more reserved. He and his loyal financeminister suggested Friday that Moscow might be prepared to waiversome of the Iraqi debts in return for better Russia-US relations."On the whole the proposal is understandable and legitimate," Putinsaid. "Russia has no objections to such a proposal."Putin concluded his two days of talks in Saint Petersburg withJacques Chirac of France and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder onSaturday still urging for a central role for the United Nations in apost-war revival of Iraq.The call reflected the insistent demand made by the three leadersbefore the US-British invasion of Iraq that UN approval was essentialfor any mission to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.But the Saint Petersburg summit ended without any formal declarationon Iraq.And diplomats noted that Putin appeared uncomfortable at being soclosely associated with the anti-Washington stance of Schroeder andChirac amid his developing friendship with Bush.Putin had even secretly invited British Prime Minister Tony Blair,Bush's staunchest backer in the war on Iraq, to attend the pow-wow inSaint Petersburg's Grand Hotel Europe, although diplomats said Blairturned the offer down.It remains to be seen how successful Putin's overtures to Washingtonwill be in the face of the fervent internal hostility to the US warstance.A senior lawmaker seen as close to the Kremlin ridiculed the UnitedStates Sunday for failing to find any weapons of mass destruction inIraq."We do not think that America won," said Dmitry Rogozin, the head ofthe lower house of parliament's foreign affairs committee, toldRossia television."Where are those chemical weapons?" he demanded.And Putin's media aide, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, told Kommersant Russiawould not forgive the Iraqi debt."(Washington) should not be so generous at other people's expense,"he said.

===========Input: Russia misplayed Iraq hand, but damage to US relations not fatal:analysts by Dmitry Zaks MOSCOW, April 17 (AFP)Silence is golden -- especially when your hand is weak -- top Moscowpolicy analysts said in an assessment of the fallout from Russia'svocal opposition to what turned out to be a swift US-led campaign inIraq.Several top diplomacy experts told a Kremlin-run forum that countrieslike China and India that said little about the conflict before itsMarch 20 launch were already reaping the benefits.Some suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin will now bescrambling to contain the damage to his once-budding friendship withUS President George W. Bush because he was poorly advised by hisintelligence and defense aides.One analyst said China -- which like Russia and France wields a UNSecurity Council veto but never threatened to use it to prevent thewar -- recently won its role as chief mediator between the UnitedStates and North Korea because other regional powers' confidence inRussia fell as a result of its Iraqi diplomacy."We are losing our positions in Asia because ... this failure of astrategic triangle that (Foreign Minister Igor) Ivanov invented withGermany and France," fumed Andrei Piontkovsky of Moscow's Center ofStrategic Studies.Negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang on their nucleardispute have been set for April 23 in Bejing and are widely seen hereas a blow to Moscow efforts to stamp authority on the region byorganizing such a meeting.Meanwhile the European "peace camp" troika finds itself in trickydiplomatic isolation from Washington.French President Jacques Chirac received only a reserved responsewhen he tried to mend fences by placing a telephone call Tuesday toBush.Meanwhile German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has not spoken to Bushsince several weeks before the start of the war.But not everyone here agreed that Moscow's diplomatic relations withWashington had suffered as badly.Most agreed that Russian diplomacy miscalculated and urged Putin toquickly reassess the quality of his advisers."Our analysis of foreign policy is lacking and often reverts to ColdWar stereotypes," said former deputy foreign minister AnatolyAdamishin."We were so proud of forming an antiwar bloc with France and Germany-- but nations have not been forming such blocs for at least 12 yearsand someone in Moscow should have understood that it was impossibleto avert this war.""Our main goal now is to make sure that our relations with the UnitedStates do not suffer further -- and I think this is possible."US diplomats have hinted in recent weeks that Washington's anger withEuropean resistance to the campaign was focused more on Paris -- andto a lesser extent Berlin -- than it was with Moscow.Putin last spoke to Bush on April 5 at the US president's owninitiative. They are scheduled to meet next in the Russian leader'snative city of Saint Petersburg in late May."We lost nothing and won nothing -- this was not our war," saidliberal lawmaker Irina Khakamada of the Union of Rightist Forces."We showed the Americans that we would not give up on our position inIraq cheaply and we did not. We should continue sticking to ourprinciples."Khakamada argued that the United States would also need Russia's help"to make the new Iraqi government seem legitimate."Most analysts linked Russia's opposition to a war in Iraq to fearsthat it will lose oil contracts that were sealed with the now-toppledregime of Saddam Hussein.The floodgates of Iraqi oil are also now likely to open to worldmarkets and hurt Russia's budget revenues -- which are heavilyreliant on revenues from its own energy exports.But few at the Kremlin forum suggested that Putin's own standingamong voters will be hurt by Russia's apparent diplomacy failures.Putin will face re-election in March 2004 and analysts noted that thewar -- while opposed by most Russians -- was never turned by theKremlin into a matter of national security."I do not think that this will affect the elections unless Russia'sfailure in Iraq is presented as an issue of national security -- andhas not been yet," said Viktor Kuvaldin of a research center fundedby former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev.

===========Input: North Korea nuclear bombshell sparks alarm, appeals for calm byCharles Whelan = (PICTURE, GRAPHIC) = SEOUL, April 25 (AFP)US allegations that North Korea admitted to possessing nuclearweapons triggered alarm across Asia Friday and prompted appeals forcalm from world capitals.The admission, according to US sources, came during three-day talksin Beijing which concluded Friday, the first meeting between US andNorth Korean officials since the nuclear crisis erupted six monthsago.China expressed hopes that both sides would keep the dialogue alivewhile officials in Moscow and London called for patience in resolvingthe complex impasse.South Korea and Japan were cautious, with Seoul Foreign Minister YoonYoung-Kwan saying if the North Koreans were telling the truth, itwould represent a "major" threat to peace in Northeast Asia.US sources with authoritative knowledge of the Beijing meetings saidthe head of the North Korean delegation Li Gun had confirmed to USenvoy James Kelly that the Stalinist state had developed nuclearweapons and hinted it may sell or use them, depending on US actions."They said what we always knew, that they do have weapons," one USsource said. "That doesn't shock us, we have been saying it. Now theyhave said it."Li also told Kelly that North Korea had gone ahead with reprocessing8,000 spent fuel rods at its Yongbyon plant, which could produceenough weapons grade plutonium for several more nuclear bombs, saidthe sources who requested anonymity.An angry US President George W. Bush accused Pyongyang of revertingto blackmail following the nuclear admission and North Korea firedback with a charge that Washington had rejected a "bold" plan toresolve the six-month-old impasse.The outcome of the talks plunged financial markets into freefall inSeoul with analysts saying they saw no sign of a recovery any timesoon.Despite the leaked details about the meetings, US officials publiclydeclined to confirm any of North Korea's announcements, with US StateDepartment spokesman Richard Boucher saying comments made by NorthKoreans "require careful analysis."China, playing host to the talks, tried to put a positive spin on thetalks which Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing said signified "a goodbeginning.""We hope that all sides can continue to make efforts to peacefullyresolve the Korean nuclear issue," Li was quoted by the officialXinhua news agency as saying.He said Korean nuclear issue was "very complicated and sensitive,"but the key was to "not mind the other side's rhetoric," but "payattention to its actions."A top Russian foreign ministry official called for patience andBritain's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw echoed the call in a BBC radiointerview.Kelly, the US assistant secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs,arrived in Seoul from Beijing Friday to brief Yoon, the foreignminister."If it is true that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, this wouldbe a major breach of peace on the Korean peninsula as well as inNortheast Asia," said Yoon.Kelly, who declined to talks to reporters here, travels to TokyoSunday for talks with Japanese officials. He has made no publiccomments so far on the Beijing talks.However US Secretary of State Colin Powell said the talks hadfeatured "strong views" on all sides and insisted that the UnitedStates would not bow to blackmail, threats or "bellicose statements."North Korea, in its first official comment on the outcome of thetalks, accused Washington of ruling out Pyongyang's "bold" plan forpeace while offering nothing new itself.A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman, quoted by the officialKorean Central News Agency, made no reference to the reports thatNorth Korea had admitted to possessing nuclear weapons."At the talks the DPRK (North Korea) set forth a new bold proposal toclear up bilateral concerns of the DPRK and the US, and the partiesconcerned with the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, at the sametime," the unnamed official was quoted as saying."The US, however, repeated its old assertion that the DPRK should'scrap its nuclear program before dialogue' without advancing any newproposal at the talks."The official did not disclose what North Korea's bold plan was.

===========Input: NKorea offers to scrap nuke, missile programs but wants bigconcessions: USby Matthew LeeATTENTION - UPDATES ///WASHINGTON, April 28 (AFP) - North Korea has offered to scrap itsnuclear weapons and missile programs, but only in return for"considerable" diplomatic, political and economic concessions, theUnited States said Monday.Secretary of State Colin Powell said the offer was made duringthree-way talks between US, North Korean and Chinese diplomats lastweek in Beijing.At the same meeting Pyongyang confirmed it had nuclear weapons, andthreatened to prove it with a "display.""The North Koreans acknowledged a number of things that they weredoing and, in effect, said that these are now up for furtherdiscussion," he told reporters at the State Department."They did put forward a plan that would ultimately deal with theirnuclear capability and their missile activities, but they, of course,expect something considerable in return," Powell said."We are studying that plan, we are examining it with our friends andallies," Powell said, adding that talks were now underway with theSouth Korean, Japanese, Russian and Australian as well as othergovernments."It was useful to get it all out on the table and see where we gofrom here," he said, referring to the April 23 to 25 discussions inBeijing.Powell gave no indication as to whether Washington would accept theoffer, and did not address what Pyongyang was demanding in terms ofconcesssions.However other US officials said the North Koreans had presented alengthy list of demands.The demands include full normalization of ties with the UnitedStates, security guarantees and economic assistance that include oiland other energy considerations."They had quite a list of things," State Department spokesman RichardBoucher told reporters.Asked specifically about normalization of relations and economicassistance, Boucher replied: "I don't really quibble with thatcharacterization of the list."A senior State Department official said later that the list ofdemands was so extensive that it defied a "concise description.""It basically listed everything they have ever asked for," theofficial told reporters on condition of anonymity, identifying oiland energy supplies as demands.Although the North Korean demands are being looked at, Boucherrepeated long-standing US policy that Washington would not beblackmailed or otherwise threatened into buying Pyongyang off."We've made clear we're not going to pay for elimination of thenuclear weapons programs that never should have begun in the firstplace," he said.Powell acknowledged that North Korea had hinted it could prove itpossessed nuclear weapons with some sort of display during theBeijing talks, but maintained that the North Koreans had not used thewords "test" or "testing.""They said that it is the kind of capability that one can display inone way or another," he said.The concessions demanded by Pyongyang were part of a "bold" proposalfor addressing the nuclear situation on the Korean peninsula thatNorth Korea presented in Beijing, officials said.South Korean newspapers reported earlier Monday that the Northsuggested that Pyongyang and Washington act simultaneously andequally to resolve the six-month-old nuclear crisis.Boucher ruled out simultaneous steps by both sides, stressing thatWashington would not consider such moves until the "verifiable andirreversible termination" of the north's nuclear programs."We (have) made clear that once North Korea did that, we could moveon or move back to the comprehensive approach to US-North Korearelations that we had talked about before," he said.South Korea's Munhwa Ilbo newspapers and others quoted unnamed SouthKorean government sources as saying Pyongyang also urged Washingtonnot to hinder its efforts to establish and improve ties with Seouland Tokyo.The North's ruling Workers Party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, indicatedSunday that North Korea wanted economic and political "rewards" fromthe United States in return for the elimination of its nuclearprogram.Rodong called for a "fair and equal" footing in talks with the UnitedStates, blasting Washington for insisting that there would be "nosecurity of the system nor provision of rewards" even if Pyongyanggave up its nuclear program.It insisted North Korea could do "everything" to defend itself if theUnited States "legally guarantees no use of arms including nukes".

===========Input: MCI to pay huge fine to SEC for accounting fraud: report WASHINGTON, May 19 (AFP)MCI, formerly WorldCom, and the Securities and Exchange Commissionhave reached a final agreement in the telecom giant's11-billion-dollar (9.4-billion-euro) fraud case, The Wall StreetJournal reported Monday.Under terms of the agreement, to be submitted as early as Monday to ajudge presiding over the case, MCI would agree to pay the largestfine imposed so far by the SEC on a company that is not abroker-dealer, the Journal said, citing sources close to the matter.The report did not give the amount of the fine, but said it would be"exponentially larger" than the historic 10 million dollars Xeroxpaid the SEC last year.Last month, the SEC slapped fines totaling 1.4 billion dollars on 10Wall Street brokerages to settle charges of conflicts of interestbetween analysts and investors.MCI and the SEC negotiated the agreement for months after a partialsettlement in November under which MCI, formerly known as WorldCom,agreed not to mislead investors about its finances, and to improveinternal controls, the Journal said.The estimated value of the fraud has reached historic proportions,swelling from the initially announced 3.5 million dollars to 11million dollars as revelations of misconduct piled on, the reportsaid.Separately, former WorldCom CEO Bernard Ebbers failed on April 29 tomake a first repayment of 25 million dollars, plus interest, on a400-million-dollar loan from MCI, the Journal said, citing SECdocuments.Because he is now in default MCI must now seize additional assetsowned by Ebbers, to secure the loan. The company has already sold hisGeorgia-based yacht building business for 15 million dollars, and isclose to selling his ranch in British Colombia, which is expected tobring 60 to 70 million dollars, the Journal said.

===========Input: Shiites openly mark Mohammed's birthday in Iraq as lawlessness stillreigns = (PICTURES) = BAGHDAD, May 19 (AFP)Shiite Muslims in Iraq Monday celebrated openly for the first time indecades Prophet Mohammed's birthday, as continuing anarchy and chaosthreatened to undermine US efforts to rebuild the war-ravagedcountry.Meanwhile coalition officials in Iraq insisted plans for an Iraqigovernment were still on track and Russia hinted that a compromisecould be imminent on a UN draft resolution to lift economic sanctionson Iraq.Thousands of Iraq's majority Shiite Muslims marched to their mainmosque in Baghdad to mark the birthday of Islam's founder ProphetMohammed.Shiites, who celebrate the birthday a week later than Sunni Muslims,were forbidden to publicly mark the date under the regime of SaddamHussein's Sunni-dominated regime.The crowd filled the street leading to the Kazimiya mosque in thenortheast of Baghdad and carried banners in the green color of Islam,calling for good government."No to injustice," "No to occupation," "No to Israel," "Yes toIslam," chanted the demonstrators as speeches began from a platform.Imam Mohammad al-Fartussi, who last week threatened violence against"sinful" women, alcohol vendors and cinemas showing "indecent" films,offered praise for the fall of Saddam and called Iraq "the land ofimams... land of Islam."The demonstration came as Iraq's top US overseer Paul Bremer beganhis second week on the job amid continuing lawlessness in thecountry.In his frenzied first seven days, the telegenic Bremer repeatedlypromised to restore the law and order that crumbled along with SaddamHussein's regime nearly six weeks ago.But despite issuing a host of tough decrees, Bremer has failed tostem the rampant crime and street violence plaguing the country.Despite a security crackdown over the weekend in Baghdad and anannouncement that some 7,000 policemen had returned to their jobssince the end of the war, ordinary Iraqis still felt unsafe on thestreet with gunfire rife and police a near invisible presence.In Baghdad, almost all the police stations have been destroyed orlooted since US troops took control of the capital on April 9. Onlytwo have so far reopened, and they have no equipment whatsoever.Baghdad's top police job remains vacant.And a trip to Baghdad's looter market only bears witness to the factthat criminals are ruling the roost in the post-Saddam era.Packed with the piles of stolen goods picked up during the frenzy oftheft that followed the collapse of Saddam's regime, the traders dealin everything from computers and stereos to furniture and weapons.Jalal Jamil, a 45-year-old jewellery store owner, said the situationjust keeps getting worse. "The Americans encourage people to stealbecause when looting happens right under their noses they donothing," he said.Bremer has also been criticized for backing away from an earlier UStimeline on forming a government in Iraq, but US-led coalitionofficials Monday insisted government plans were still on track."We want to have an Iraqi voice in everything we do here but it wouldbe wrong to do that precipitously," said a source at the Organisationof Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), which isadministering post-war Iraq.Officials from Iraqi groups that met with Bremer last week have saidthat he back peddled on what they said were earlier pledges to givethem a lead role in forming a new interim government in the next fewweeks."We understand that they want to have as much power as possible butwe told them: 'You won't be directly elected, you won't have anydirect experience of government," the source said."'Of course you will have input into the government but, since youare not directly elected, it would be a nonsense for you to havedirect executive power,' the source said."The last thing we want is to leave a bunch of self-appointedoligarchs in power," the source said.The comments came on the same day that a prominent Iraqi called forinternationally-supervised elections in Iraq.Adnan Pachachi, a onetime foreign minister who returned to Iraq onMay 6 after 33 years in exile, told the independent Az-Zaman dailythat elections should be held under international supervision.An interim government should create an election code and laws toclear the way for direct elections to a constituent assembly, thatwould draw up a constitution, Pachachi said.A referendum on the constitution would lead to elections for a newgovernment, the 80-year-old Pachachi told the daily.On the diplomatic front, a top Russian official said Monday that theUN Security Council would likely vote this week on a US-British draftresolution to lift economic sanctions placed on Iraq in 1990 afterits invasion of Kuwait and to place its oil riches under coalitioncontrol for at least a year."An updated text of the document may already be published today andmay be put to a vote this week," Deputy Foreign Minister Yury Fedotovtold ITAR-TASS news agency.Yet Fedotov did not say whether Russia would back the resolution,which diplomats have been revising since the United States, Britainand Spain first submitted it more than a week ago.Russia "will vote depending on what the resolution text turns out tobe," he said.With billions of dollars in oil and debt interests in Iraq, Russiahas been anxious to secure UN involvement before supporting theresolution.Australia announced the creation Monday of an expert panel to helpIraq protect its rich cultural heritage and assist Interpol inrecovering looted ancient artefacts.

===========Input: Chinese leader favours Russia in first foreign tour by Henry Meyer MOSCOW, May 23 (AFP)Highlighting close ties between Moscow and Beijing, Chinese PresidentHu Jintao Monday will make Russia his first foreign destination sincebecoming leader in a visit that could seal a major pipeline accord.Hu, who was appointed to the top job in March, will meet his Russiancounterpart Vladimir Putin during his three-day state visit from May26 to 28. He will then stay on for a regional summit before headingto Saint Petersburg for celebrations marking the 300th anniversary ofthe city's founding."This upcoming visit to Russia will be my first trip aboard since Ibecame president of China. I plan a thorough exchange of views withPresident Vladimir Putin on bilateral and important regional andinternational issues," Hu said in an interview with Russia's Interfaxnews agency."Our discussions should strengthen political trust between the twosides and mutually beneficial cooperation to raise Russian-Chineserelations to a new level," he added.Putin, who enjoyed a warm relationship with former Chinese presidentJiang Zeming, has made efforts to nurture ties with Hu and was thefirst world leader to go to Beijing to meet him in December when hewas president-in-waiting."Presidents Vladimir Putin and Hu Jintao have developed good personalcontacts, which will undoubtedly facilitate the promotion of theRussian strategic partnership," Russia's ambassador to China IgorRogachyov said, quoted by Interfax.Russia has given a high priority to its relations with the UnitedStates despite a bitter disagreement over the US-led campaign totopple Saddam Hussein in Iraq.But China remains a key Russian ally, demonstrated by the fact thatHu will be the only foreign leader apart from US President George W.Bush to hold a summit with Putin in the days surrounding the SaintPetersburg festivities.Leaders of the two Asian giants, according to UFG financialbrokerage, may ink a deal for the construction of a 2,400 kilometre(1,500-mile) oil pipeline from eastern Siberia to the Chinese city ofDaqing, bringing Russian crude to energy-hungry China.Although the Russian government is formally committed to building anextension of the pipeline that would supply Japan through the Russianport of Nakhodka, experts believe that project is unlikely to see thelight of day.Russian oil giant Yukos, whose output will be shipped through thepipeline, had lobbied furiously for the Chinese route although thestate pipeline monopoly Transneft argued that it was wrong to tiestrategic Russian energy resources to the whims of a single buyer."Single customers are always a danger. However, the project makeseconomic sense," commented Asia expert Dmitry Trenin, deputy directorin Moscow of the Carnegie Center, a Washington-based think tank.The shorter Chinese route, a 2,400-kilometre project, would costaround half the Japanese pipeline, at 2.5 billion dollars (2.15billion euros), and would need to transport just 20 million tonnes ayear to be economic.China, whose booming economy has turned the country into anincreasingly valuable economic partner for Russia, especially in itsbackward far eastern regions, is also a major purchaser of Russianweapons."It's a very important relationship. China is a very dynamicneighbour and a rising world power. In many ways it is far ahead ofRussia," Trenin said.The Chinese president expressed the hope that bilateral trade couldbe raised from its current level of 12 billion dollars a year to 20billion dollars.Analysts however cautioned against any attempt to turn the focus fromeconomic cooperation to a broader strategic alliance, given that bothsides opposed the war in Iraq."The Chinese are trying to establish a rapport (between Hu and Putin)and this is in Russia's interests. However, this rapport should notserve the role of forming an alliance to counter American dominancein the world," said Trenin."A lot can be said for an amicable, neighbourly relationship betweenMoscow and Beijing and this is what the rapport should serve," headded.

Bush andRussian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday their friendship was asstrong as ever, laying aside a dispute over the Iraq war, but barelyconcealing a simmering row over Iran's nuclear program.After talks in Saint Petersburg's grand Konstantinovsky Palace, theyalso warned North Korea to abandon its nuclear aspirations and signeddocuments implementing the Moscow Treaty, which mandates sharp cutsin Cold War nuclear weapons stocks.Swapping smiles, handshakes and hugs at a joint press appearanceafter talks linked to Saint Petersburg's 300th anniversarycelebrations, Bush and Putin set out to recreate the buddy atmosphereof their previous encounters."Our relations are stronger than the events that tested it," saidPutin, stressing that despite diverging over Iraq, Russia and theUnited States had many common interests."It is precisely these things that enable me to call President Bushmy friend, not only personally -- because I do like him a lot -- butas my counterpart and the president of a friendly nation," he said,earning a grin from Bush.But both men observed an uneasy truce over US concerns about Russianaid to the nuclear program of Iran, whom Bush has labeled part of an"axis of evil" that also included Iraq and North Korea."We are concerned about Iran's advanced nuclear program and urge Iranto comply in full with its obligations under the NuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty," Bush said.A senior US diplomat said Bushehr remains one of the biggestirritants in Russia-US relations."We think that it would be wise for Russia to go slow on the Bushehrproject until the wider Iranian nuclear program is more clearlyunderstood," the US diplomat said after the informal summit talks."Our belief is that any proliferation, coming from any source, shouldbe stopped."The United States believes that what Iran says is a peaceful civiliannuclear program is a pretext for weapons manufacture.Washington has been pressuring Russia to stop building a nuclearpower plant in Bushehr, southern Iran, which it has so far declinedto do."I appreciate Vladimir Putin's understanding of the issue and hiswillingness to work with me and others to solve this potentialproblem," said Bush.Putin insisted that the two sides were "closer than they seem" on theissue."We do not need to be convinced of the fact that there should noproliferation of weapons of mass destruction," he said.But in a sharp remark that jolted the bonhomie, Putin warned Russiawas not yet ready to sever nuclear ties with Iran."We are against the pretext of using the nuclear weapons program inIran as a lever in unfair business competition against us," he said.Bush signalled that Russia would not pay a similar price as Franceand Germany for opposing the US-led war in Iraq, inviting his "goodfriend" Putin to his weekend retreat outside Camp David in Washingtonin September.Putin last visited Bush at his Texas ranch in November 2001.There was no word on the fate of billions of dollars of Russian oilcontracts in Iraq, whose oil industry is now under the administrationof the United States and Britain in line with latest UN resolutions,which Russia was persuaded to back.But Putin noted that "Russian companies have a wealth of experienceoperating in Iraq and we intend to continue our cooperation in thisarea, with Iraq and in Iraq.""What the president (Putin) meant was that at times, and we have comeacross this, there were unreasonable complaints about Russiancompanies' cooperation with Iran," said Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,pointing the finger clearly at the United States after the summit.Bush and Putin also signed formal documents putting into effect astrategic arms reduction treaty that slashes the two sides' nuclearweapons to a range of 1,700 to 2,200 nuclear warheads by the year2012.Bush arrived in Saint Petersburg on Saturday, when he also brieflymet German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose opposition to the Iraqwar had soured his relationship with Washington, at a dinner hostedby Putin.Bush and Putin were scheduled to leave straight after their talks forthe Group of Eight summit of the largest industrialised nations inEvian, France.

===========Input: Israel hands over Rafah border crossing to Palestinians ATTENTION -RECASTS with return to pre-intifada positions, ADDS details /// GAZA CITY, June 30 (AFP)Palestinian security forces returned Monday to the positions theyheld in the Gaza Strip before the outbreak of the 33-monthPalestinian uprising as Israel removed all major checkpoints in thecoastal territory, a Palestinian security source said.Police officers took up their positions across the Gaza Strip,enjoying a freedom of movement they have not known since the intifadaexploded in September 2000, the source said."Palestinian police have taken over all the posts and positions theyheld before September 28, 2000. It is the first time they have hadfreedom of movement with cars and weapons since the start of theintifada," the source said.The move marked a huge step forward in carrying out the US-backedMiddle East "roadmap", which aims to end the months of bloodshed andcreate a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians.Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the northern town ofBeit Hanoun late Sunday, police took up positions there and in theneighbouring town of Beit Lahiya, he said.They also deployed along the border with Israel. The handover is acredibility test for the Palestinian Authority, which must show itmeans business when it comes to reining in hardline groups plottingattacks on the Jewish state.In another first in the almost three-year intifada, the Israeli armyallowed Palestinians free circulation on the trans-Gaza highway astroops abandoned three major checkpoints across the coastalterritory.Traffic was flowing freely through the Netzarim junction, just southof Gaza City, the Kissufim junction by Deir al-Balah in the centralGaza Strip, and the Guest House junction just south of Deir al-Balahafter the army withdrew.The three military checkpoints on the highway, which runs the entirelength of the Gaza Strip, had transformed the trip from north tosouth, ordinarily a 30-minute ride, into a grinding two or three-hourordeal and came to symbolise the horrors of occupation."Israel has implemented most of the agreement except for a fewissues," the source said, pointing out that Israel had still notremoved two military observation posts at the Kissufim junction andthe Guest House junction.Although there was free movement along the trans-Gaza highway,several other roads remained temporarily closed, he said.The Karni-Netzarim road, which runs east-to-west across the route,was still closed as was the section of the highway passing close byKfar Darom settlement, just south of the Guest House junction, hesaid, adding both were likely to be opened in the coming weeks.Another road, leading from the southern border town of Rafah to KhanYunis, would be opened within 10 days, he said.Adressing Palestinian complaints, an Israeli military sourceconfirmed troops had installed a gate at the Netzarim crossing and atthe southern Guest House junction but said that they were only therefor when Jewish settlers needed to use the road.A ban on Palestinian men under the age of 35 being allowed to movefreely was still in force but that was expected to be lifted later onMonday or early Tuesday.The army also handed over control of Rafah border crossing betweenthe Gaza Strip and Egypt to the Palestinians, security sources said.Six Palestinian police officers were allowed to return to thePalestinian section of the border crossing, which had been taken overby Israeli troops shortly after the start of the uprising.Under the 1993 Oslo accords, which granted a measure of autonomy tothe Palestinians, the Rafah border crossing with Egypt was to bejointly managed by both Israel and the Palestinians, although Israelhad final control over the zone.Although the crossing has, in principle, been open for movementbetween the two territories -- while being frequently closed byIsraeli for reasons rarely explained -- the Palestinian section hasbeen manned by Israel for more than two years.

===========Input: White House raises possibility it might not seek U.N. vote WithEU-GEN--Turkey-US-Iraq; UN-GEN--N-Iraq WASHINGTON (AP)With opposition hardening, the White House left open the possibilityTuesday that it would not seek a United Nations vote on itswar-making resolution if the measure was headed for defeat.``The vote is desirable. It is not necessary,'' presidentialspokesman Ari Fleischer said.The comments came as President George W. Bush and his advisers lookedbeyond the diplomatic showdown and made plans for a public relationsbuildup to potential war.One option under serious consideration was Bush giving Iraqi leaderSaddam Hussein a final ultimatum, perhaps with a short-term deadline,in a major address next week, two senior White House officials said.The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stressed that avariety of options are on the table and they all depend on theoutcome of a U.N. Security Council debate on the U.S.-backed warresolution.The United States still doesn't have the nine votes needed to winapproval of the resolution, according to supporters and opponents,and many undecided council members are looking for a compromise.Even if he gets the required votes, Bush needs to avoid a veto byRussia, France or China who all favor continuing inspections at leastinto July.Once the vote is resolved one way or another, Bush will intensify hiscase for war, officials said, barring unforeseen events such asSaddam suddenly disarming or going into exile.In addition to a possible address, they have discussed a presidentialnews conference and a Cabinet meeting as ways for Bush to communicatehis plans to the nation next week.As those discussions were taking place behind the scenes, Fleischertold reporters that Turkey would lose a proposed $15 billion aidpackage unless it admits troops into the country for the Iraqconflict.``The particular package that we've been talking to them about waspredicated on assistance and cooperation in any plan for the use offorce against Iraq,'' Fleischer said.Until Tuesday, the spokesman had suggested part of the package wouldbe available to Turkey regardless of whether 62,000 American troopsare allowed in the country. White House officials said they wereturning up pressure on Turkey in hopes that the parliament wouldgrant the U.S. request on a second vote.Even so, officials said future aid for Turkey would not be ruled out,just the massive package under consideration now.At the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan called Baghdad'smissile destruction ``a positive development,'' putting him at oddswith Bush's assessment. Russia's Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov,hardening Moscow's opposition to quick military action, indicatedRussia may use its veto against the U.S.-backed resolution.Both developments further complicated Bush's efforts to win passageof the resolution, adding significance to talk of what theadministration would do if U.N. opposition cements against the U.S.position.``The president has made clear, that ... whether the United Nationsvotes or does not vote, that we will disarm Saddam Hussein with acoalition of the willing,'' Fleischer said. ``We are proceeding withall the plans for the vote.''``Now, if you are asking me if all of a sudden support around theworld crumbles and there is absolutely no one for it, I can't predictwith metaphysical certitude every eventuality,'' Fleischer said.U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte was asked whether the United Stateswould withdraw the resolution if it didn't have the votes to pass it.``We haven't crossed that bridge,'' he said. ``We believe thatsupport should be there. We are not facing that kind of situation butwe will cross the bridge when we come to it.''Afterward, he and other White House officials said the remarks didnot signal a lack of confidence in the resolution's prospects.

===========Input: Emboldened by U.N. report, Iraq calls for end to sanctions BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)Emboldened by the latest weapons inspectors' report, Iraq on Saturdaycalled on the United Nations to remove crippling sanctions and to banweapons of mass destruction in the entire Middle East  _  andeventually in the United States.Iraq resumed destroying banned Al Samoud 2 missiles under U.N.supervision Saturday after taking a day off, crushing six more in aprocess that chief inspector Hans Blix called a ``substantial measureof disarmament.''In the past week, Iraq has destroyed 40 of its 100 Al Samoud 2missiles, prohibited by the United Nations because some testsindicated they could fly farther than 150 kilometers (93 miles). Italso has been destroying equipment used to make them.Reports to the Security Council on Friday by Blix and chief nuclearinspector Mohammed ElBaradei praised Iraq's recent compliance. Butinspectors also questioned Iraq's motivation, as it began to give theinspectors what they wanted only when the threat of war becameimmediate.U.S. President George W. Bush said the reports indicated that only awar will make Iraq disarm.``Unfortunately, it is clear that Saddam Hussein is still violatingthe demands of the United Nations by refusing to disarm,'' he toldAmericans in a radio address Saturday.Iraq, however, took the report as an endorsement of its work andargued not only that war plans should be canceled, but that sanctionsimposed on it by the Security Council for its 1990 invasion of Kuwaitshould be removed.``We demand that the Security Council and the world decide on ... thelifting of sanctions on Iraq in a comprehensive and complete way,''said a spokesman for a meeting Saturday of Saddam and top-levelofficials, quoted by official Iraqi news media.The unidentified spokesman claimed the weapons inspectors hadverified Iraq has rid itself of weapons of mass destruction  _something the inspectors said would take months to do  _  andappealed for a ban on such weapons to be extended beyond Iraq: toIsrael, and eventually to the United States.The spokesman, reporting on the meeting, said Iraq called on theSecurity Council ``to rid the Middle East of weapons of massdestruction since Iraq has become free of them.''``At the front of those that must be rid of these weapons is theZionist entity,'' he said in a reference to Israel, adding that theorder should ``move on after this region to America.''The newspaper Babil, a popular daily owned by Saddam's son Odai, alsosaid Saturday that the reports of Blix and ElBaradei were enough tosuspend the sanctions, which are to be removed when the UnitedNations verifies that Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction or themeans to make them.In a front-page editorial, Babil said the reports should pushSecurity Council members ``to think seriously about issuing aresolution lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq, since it was proventhat we don't possess weapons of mass destruction.''Saddam has long claimed Iraq destroyed all its weapons of massdestruction. The United States and Britain claim he's lying, and haveassembled a quarter-million troops around Iraq for a possibleinvasion.Despite Iraq's demands of the Security Council, diplomats wereworking hard on very different proposals: a U.S.-led plan fordisarmament or war by March 17, and a rival French plan for anemergency summit of Security Council members to come up with acompromise.Bush and top advisers planned to lobby allies by telephone throughthe weekend and up until next week's planned vote on the ultimatum.French President Jacques Chirac talked to heads of state in an effortto drum up support for his plan, his office said.Inspectors' spokesman Hiro Ueki said Iraqi workers crushed six AlSamoud 2 missiles Saturday at the al-Taji military complex north ofBaghdad, under the supervision of weapons inspectors. Three of themissiles had warheads and three didn't, apparently because theyhadn't been deployed.Inspectors also supervised the destruction of tools and ``specialequipment used to produce the Al Samoud 2 engine'' at the Al Samoudfactory, he said, and another group of inspectors verified theemptying of Al Samoud 2 warheads at the Qa Qa complex just south ofBaghdad.Odai al-Taie, a senior Information Ministry official, said theworkers crushing the missiles took Friday off because they had workedon Tuesday, the Muslim new year. Ueki described Friday as a``planning day'' for teams working on missile destruction.Ueki said an Iraqi chemical scientist granted an interview to weaponsinspectors, bringing to eight the number of scientists who have giveninterviews since Feb. 28, when Iraq began urging them to talk. Sincethe same date, four scientists have refused.Interviews with nuclear scientists have been conducted morefrequently because the nuclear inspectors don't mind the scientiststape recording the interviews, a sticking point for the chemical andbiological teams.Inspectors also returned to a former helicopter airfield where Iraqburied bombs it says were armed with biological weapons in 1991. Uekisaid inspectors there took samples from the remainders of stainlesssteel containers Iraq says it used to transport biological agents.

Macau had been taking off-track bets frompeople in Hong Kong, but the offices handling those wagers wereclosed.The Macau club later threatened to start taking wagers on Hong Kongraces in Macau, at a better price for gamblers because less tax wouldbe levied, but the plan never materialized.Neither club immediately returned phone calls from The AssociatedPress to inquire about the buyout talks.Macau is a gambling enclave 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of HongKong that was governed by the Portuguese for more than four centuriesbefore it returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1999. Hong Kong, aformer British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

===========Input: Turkish party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan named prime minister, maypush to allow in U.S. troops ANKARA, Turkey (AP)The charismatic leader of Turkey's governing party was named primeminister Tuesday, a step that probably boosts chances that the UnitedStates will get permission to deploy troops in the country alongIraq's northern border.Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who favors the deployment, hinted that he willreshuffle the Cabinet, but gave no indication if he would purgeofficials who opposed letting in the troops as analysts havesuggested he might do.Erdogan is extremely popular in Turkey and is likely be one of thefew leaders with enough clout to unite his party and gain publicsupport for allowing in the U.S. troops. Turks overwhelmingly opposea war  _  by 94 percent, according to some polls.Earlier this month, the Turkish parliament shocked the United Statesby rejecting the deployment by just four votes. Erdogan has hintedthat he will resubmit the resolution for approval, which could takeanother week.The United States is pressing Turkey to act quickly. Ships carryingequipment for U.S. troops are already waiting off the Turkish coastIn Washington, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Richard Myers tolda Pentagon news conference Tuesday that the United States would``have a northern option whether or not Turkey fully supports all ourrequests.``I'm not going to talk about the operational ways of doing it, butjust be assured there will be a northern option,'' he said.Also in Washington, Turkish Ambassador Farouk Logoglu told TheAssociated Press that the U.S. and Turkish militaries were holdinginformal discussions on the use of Turkish airspace.The troop-basing resolution would allow the United States to useTurkish airspace. If the resolution is not passed, Washington wouldlikely want to use the airspace for strikes against Iraq and forairlifting troops to northern Iraq.Refusing access to the troop deployment would mean Turkey would losea US$15 billion U.S. aid package that Washington has offered to helpcushion the country's economy if there is war.It would also threaten Turkey's possible role in the future of Iraq.Turkey, which fears northern Iraqi Kurds may declare independence inthe aftermath of a war, has been pressing for a say if Saddam Husseinis ousted. Secession by Iraqi Kurds could inspire Turkey's rebelKurds, who for 15 years have been fighting for autonomy.After he was elected, Erdogan said Turkey wanted assurances from theUnited States on its role in Iraq.Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Tuesday there had beentalks that Turkish troops could be deployed ``a short distance fromtheir border to try to avoid refugee infiltration.''Iraqi Kurds fear that Turkish troops could move deep into theautonomous enclave in northern Iraq and have threatened clashes.Rumsfeld also said that like Turkey, the United States doesn't wantto see a breakaway state: ``Our interest, needless to say, is to seethat Iraq remains a single country,'' he said at the Pentagon newsconference.Prime Minister Abdullah Gul resigned earlier Tuesday to make way forErdogan, who won a parliamentary seat in by-elections Sunday. Gulwill remain as a caretaker prime minister until President AhmetNecdet Sezer approves Erdogan's Cabinet, a move that could happen asearly as Wednesday.Erdogan said he would submit his Cabinet list to the president ``assoon as possible,'' and leaders of Erdogan's Justice and DevelopmentParty met Tuesday evening.When asked about possible changes in the Cabinet, Erdogan said:``Perhaps there will be a small amount of change, a certain number ofrevisions.''Gul's resignation had been long expected. Erdogan heads the party butwas constitutionally barred from running in November electionsbecause he was jailed in 1999 for anti-secular activities. TheJustice party changed the constitution after taking power in theelections.Erdogan, a leader of Turkey's pro-Islamic movement when he wasjailed, said he moderated his policies in prison. His party considersitself conservative and no longer uses the word 'Islamic' in itsliterature.He now also advocates letting in U.S. troops for a war against Iraqeven though it is a fellow Muslim state.Unlike the soft-spoken Gul, Erdogan has a reputation as a fighter.``Erdogan will be willing to engage in a bruising confrontation in away that Gul was not willing to,'' said Bulent Aliriza, an analyst atthe Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.``If Erdogan decides that for his own reasons, and not U.S. pressure,he wants this, he will push it through.''Tensions over the basing agreement spilled over into parliamentTuesday when opposition deputy Ufuk Ozkan shouted ``You are allAmerican lackeys!'' at members of Erdogan's party, the Anatolia newsagency reported.A furious Justice party member, Fehmi Husrev Kutlu, rushed towardOzkan, bumping into him and sending his eyeglasses flying, Anatoliareported. Other legislators surrounded the two to head off a brawl.

===========Input: EU rift over Iraq remains as France, Germany denounce U.S. move towar BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP)Europe's divide over Iraq loomed ever larger Tuesday with France andGermany denouncing the U.S. move toward war while British PrimeMinister Tony Blair said ousting Saddam Hussein now was key tosolving similar crises in the future.As European Union leaders restated their opposing views on Iraq,their foreign ministers debated the impending U.S.-led war againstIraq with EU president Greece keeping up appearances with a pledge topursue a last ditch effort to avoid war.Joschka Fischer and Dominique de Villepin, the German and Frenchforeign ministers, were to attend a special United Nations SecurityCouncil meeting in New York Wednesday, called to issue a last-minuteappeal for a peaceful solution to the Iraq crisis.''For us the United Natgions is the key authority'' in resolving theIraq crisis, Fischer told reporters opn arrival at the EU meeting.''War is not justified,'' Fishcer told reporters. ''As members of theUnited Nations Security Council we want to restate that we want apeacefiul solution.''De Villepin made no comment on arrival. Ahead of the EU meeting,Greek Foreign Minister Georhge Papandreou told reporters, ''We haveto, and we will continue, to search for a peaceful solution to thecrisis.''The EU meeting could not hide the fact the Iraq crisis has made amockery of EU aspirations to craft a common foreign policy.Britain, Spain, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal back theUnited States while France and Germany lead a group of nationsopposing military action.``I would like to see that the European Union countries will comethrough this difficult moment with a determination to work for peaceand look to the future,'' EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana said.British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw remained in London for a debatein which the Blair government sought parliamentary approval for itsdecision to use ``all means necessary'' to disarm Saddam.Blair was confident of retaining the support of a majority ofparliament as he can count on votes from opposition Conservatives. Hetold the House of Commons the Iraq crisis was testing thefundamentals of international relations.``It will determine the way Britain and the world confront thecentral security threat of the 21st century; the development of theUnited Nations; the relationship between Europe and the UnitedStates; the relations within the European Union; and the way that theUnited States engages with the rest of the world,'' said Blair.``It will determine the pattern of international politics for thenext generation,'' he said.The EU foreign ministers met hours after U.S. President George W.Bush gave Saddam 48 hours to leave Iraq or face invasion.French President Jacques Chirac said war without U.N blessing wouldundermine future disarmament efforts. ``Inspections (in Iraq) showedthat they are a credible alternativ,'' Chirac said. ``To act withoutthe legitimacy of the United Nations ... to favor the use of forceover law, is taking a serious responsibility.''In Berlin, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said there was nojustification for war. ``Does the threat posed by the Iraqi dictatorjustify a war, which is sure to kill thousands of innocent children,women and men? My answer in this case was and is: No!'' Schroedersaid.Solana said the EU would help in the humanitarian crisis expected tofollow an attack on Iraq. The EU is set to release 20 million euros(US$21.5 million) in immediate humanitarian aid for Iraq if warbreaks out and may dip into an ``emergency reserve'' of 250 millioneuros (US$269 million) for humanitarian relief.Elsewhere in Europe:	 _  Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt,overruling his defense minister, said his government would allow theUnited States use of its territory for military transports. In recentweeks, the U.S. military has been transporting military equipmentfrom bases in Germany to the Gulf through the port of Antwerp.Defense Minister Andre Flahaut said on the weekend Belgium would nolonger allow such transits  _  or use of Belgian airspace.     _ Greece began evacuating its embassy in Baghdad, saying all itspersonnel would be out of Iraq within a couple of days.     _  TheDutch government, facing strong public anti-war pressure, said itwould not commit fighting forces to the war against Iraq but added itsupported the military campaign to disarm Saddam.     _  In neutralSwitzerland, Foreign Minister Micheline Calmy-Rey said the UnitedStates' decision to proceed with military action weakened the UnitedNations. ``It will be up to U.N. member states to restore itscredibility,'' she said.

===========Input: U.S. and British troops move on Basra following assault on Baghdad SOUTHERN IRAQ (AP)U.S. and British troops were moving on the strategic southern portcity of Basra Saturday after a massive aerial assault pounded Baghdadat dawn. Thousands of beleaguered Iraqi soldiers in the southsurrendered in the face of the major push.The battle for Basra, an oil hub of some 1.3 million people, wasunderway by midday, with coalition troops trying to surround Iraqipositions and force a surrender. U.S. aircraft bombed Iraqi tanksholding bridges close to the city. Iraqi forces responded withartillery fire.Earlier Saturday, Baghdad was again targeted, one day after a massiveU.S. aerial bombardment in which more than 300 Tomahawk cruisemissiles rained down on the capital. The nine-story SecurityHeadquarters in the Iraqi capital took a direct hit, strewing bricks,masonry and glass across the street in the al-Salhiya neighborhood ofcentral Baghdad.As coalition troops advanced, an entire Iraqi army division gaveitself up, U.S. military officials said.The division  _  the 51st Infantry Division, with 8,000 men and asmany as 200 tanks, a key unit in the defense of Basra  _  was thelargest defection in a day when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's forcesshowed signs of crumbling.Allied successes were marred by the collision of two Royal Navyhelicopters over the Persian Gulf in which all six British crewmembers and one American were killed.Saturday morning, American Marines and British troops rumbled alongthe main road from the Kuwaiti border to Basra, Highway 80, nicknamedthe ``Highway of Death'' during the 1991 Gulf War, when U.S.airstrikes wiped out an Iraqi military convoy along it.American units advancing west of Basra have already secured theRumeila oil field, whose daily output of 1.3 million barrels makes itIraq's most productive.Until Basra, U.S. and British troops had encountered littleresistance, even when they seized nearby Umm Qasr, and moved tosecure key oil fields. Iraqis mostly fought back with small arms,pistols, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades.Regular Iraqi forces had withdrawn from Basra but elements ofSaddam's security forces are continuing to resist, British DefenseSecretary Geoff Hoon said Saturday.Other units moved into airfield complexes in western Iraq believed tohave Scud missiles capable of reaching Israel, and possibly weaponsof mass destruction.Early Saturday, more units were waiting in Kuwait to smash throughany Iraqi resistance. Hundreds of tanks, armored personnel carriers,Humvees and trucks were lined up in parallel columns waiting insingle-file to cross the Iraqi-Kuwait border.By early next week, U.S. ground forces led by the Army's 3rd InfantryDivision are likely to be at the outskirts of Baghdad, where theycould face greater danger from the Republican Guard, some commanderssaid.After weeks of delay, Turkey relented and agreed to let combataircraft fly over its territory. At the same time, however, Turkeysent 1,000 troops into northern Iraq, and the government said itwould send more to prevent Iraqi Kurds from creating an independentstate. The United States strongly opposes any unilateral move byTurkey into northern Iraq.A Turkish military spokesman on Saturday denied Turkish troops hadcrossed into Iraq.The United States and Britain suffered their first casualtiesThursday and Friday as they pushed into Iraq, with two U.S. Marineskilled in combat and another eight British and four American Marinesdying in a helicopter crash that appeared to be accidental. There wasno clear figure of Iraqi casualties.Australian commandos, who have been operating deep in Iraq, destroyeda command and control post and killed a number of soldiers, accordingto the country's defense chief, Gen. Peter Cosgrove.In an address Saturday, Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaftold Iraqis that fighting had been ``fierce.'' He said most of thosecaptured by allied forces were civilians, not soldiers. He claimedIraqi troops had destroyed five tanks.	 He said more than 200 Iraqishad been injured, including women, children and other civilians whowere being treated at five hospitals in Baghdad.Hoon said Saddam's regime was crumbling under the pressure of a hugeair assault. ``As last night's dramatic television coverage showed,the lights stayed on in Baghdad, but the instruments of tyranny arecollapsing,'' he said.Iraqi Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan, speaking on Iraqi Radio, wasquoted by the British Broadcasting Corp.'s monitoring service asaccusing Britain and the United States of working to ``eliminate''the state of Iraq.In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Ramadan said, ``Itis also regrettable and deplorable that the (U.N.) GeneralSecretariat has not issued any statement or reaction that condemns ordeplores this aggression.''Despite the heavy bombing, which the U.S. Central Command saidtargeted military command and control installations, the Iraqi regimegave no sign of quitting. Bombers have also hit targets in thenorthern cities of Mosul, Kirkuk and Tikrit, Saddam's hometown.The Iraqi government released a video of Saddam, in uniform, meetingwith his son Qusai, the commander of the Republican Guard, and thedefense minister, Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmad. It was unclear when thevideo was made.U.S. intelligence officials said the Iraqi command and control systemwas in disarray, and U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said,``The regime is starting to lose control of their country.''

===========Input: Jack Welch seeks details on estranged wife's work in divorce case BRIDGEPORT, Connecticut (AP)Retired General Electric Co. Chairman Jack Welch is seekingwork-related documents of his estranged wife in his high-stakesdivorce case.The Welches disclosed their plans to divorce a year ago, shortlyafter Suzy Wetlaufer  _  then editor of the Harvard Business Review _ revealed she had become romantically involved with Welch whileworking on a story about him.In court papers filed this week in state Supreme Court in New York,Welch requested a deposition next month of David Heleniak, a seniorpartner in the law firm of Shearman & Sterling in New York. Healso wants to subpoena all documents maintained in Jane BeasleyWelch's personnel file by Shearman & Sterling, a prestigiouscorporate law firm where she worked before she married Welch.Welch specifically is seeking performance evaluations, correspondencebetween his estranged wife and partners while she worked at the lawfirm's office in London, and documents related to her prospects ofbecoming a partner.Welch also wants details on Jane Beasley Welch's salary, benefits,retirement plan and other compensation paid to her.Michael York, one of Jack Welch's attorneys, called the move routine.A judge ruled in February that depositions in the divorce case willremain confidential.Earlier documents in the case have included embarrassing detailsabout perks Welch received as part of his retirement package from GEat a time when corporate scandals were sparking outrage.The court order was requested by Jack Welch's attorney, Daniel K.Webb, who said Welch would likely be asked about his businessdealings, his health and entries in his personal diary.Webb also said details of the breakdowns of the Welches' previousmarriages were likely to come up, and cited reports of allegedextramarital affairs by both.Welch has previously failed in an attempt to temporarily seal afinancial affidavit.

===========Input: First relief convoy arrives in Iraq as allies struggle to clear theway UMM QASR, Iraq (AP)The first sizable relief convoy arrived in Iraq during a sandstormWednesday as allied forces struggled to clear the way for more aidshipments, using dolphins to remove mines from waterways and huntingIraqi fighters around the port of Umm Qasr.Three days after U.S. President George W. Bush promised ``massiveamounts'' of humanitarian aid, seven large, battered tractor-trailersarrived in Umm Qasr carrying food and water donated by Kuwaitis. Theconvoy was escorted by U.S. soldiers.``We planned for 30 trucks but we only got seven loaded because ofthe severe sandstorm,'' said E.J. Russell of the HumanitarianOperations Center, a joint U.S.-Kuwaiti agency. The storm cutvisibility to about 100 yards (91 meters).Hundreds of cases of water were stacked on three of the trucks. Therest carried boxes of tuna, crackers, sweets and other food.As the trucks lumbered past blasted buildings on the Iraq-Kuwaitborder, an Iraqi boy of about 10 pointed to his mouth and shouted``Eat, eat!''People lined up along the streets, giving thumbs-up signs to the aidconvoy as it rolled by and begging for food and cigarettes.After days of fierce fighting that shut down the city of Umm Qasr,Iraqi youths cheered and swarmed British troops as they handed outyellow meal packets and bottles of water Wednesday. The troops,already in the city, were not part of the aid convoy.``Umm Qasr is now secure  _  as a port and as a town,'' said Brig.Jim Dutton of the Royal Marines.The town's deepwater port, the only one in Iraq, is essential for anyrelief effort.Plans to bring supplies to Iraqi civilians had been on hold for daysbecause of fighting across southern Iraq. On Tuesday, U.N.Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned U.S. national security adviserCondoleezza Rice that the United States is legally responsible forproviding relief aid.White House spokesman Ari Fleischer blamed Saddam Hussein's regimefor slowing the flow of US$105 million in U.S. aid by placing minesin the port of Umm Qasr.U.S. Navy helicopters flew two dolphins  _  Makai and Tacoma  _ intoUmm Qasr, where they were to begin ferreting out mines Wednesday.Royal Marine commandos carried out an overnight sweep around theport, searching for Iraqi holdouts. The British said they had enoughcontrol over the area to begin sending in ships.A British ship, the Sir Galahad, moved into position at the mouth ofthe Khor Abdallah river Tuesday night with 211 tons of food and 101tons of bottled water. It was to begin the six-hour journey into UmmQasr on Wednesday, according to a pool report.Iraqis have about five weeks of food left, according to estimates bythe World Food Program. About 13 million people  _  60 percent ofIraq's 22 million  _  are completely dependent on food handouts,The World Food Program, a U.N. agency, said it would make its biggestsingle request for cash in its history	_  more than US$1 billion tohelp feed the war-stricken nation for about six months.``This could well turn into the largest humanitarian operation inhistory,'' said agency spokesman Trevor Rowe.Before the war, Iraqis depended on government rations distributedunder the U.N.'s oil-for-food program. The 7-year-old program allowsIraq to sell unlimited quantities of oil to buy food, medicine andother humanitarian goods. The proceeds from oil sales are depositedin a U.N.-controlled escrow account.The war has thrown the future of that program in doubt.Because the United States and Britain failed to get U.N. backing forthe war, Russia, France, Germany and China want to ensure that theimmediate humanitarian costs of the war are paid by the United States _  and not the United Nations.Annan wants to revive the U.N. aid program as quickly as possible. Aresolution giving him authority to run the program for 45 days isstalled because Russia, Syria and others are insisting the UnitedNations must not sanction the war or give the United States controlover the U.N.-controlled account, which holds billions of dollars.Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh accused the United Statesand Britain of causing the hardships by launching the war anddisrupting shipments of supplies under the oil-for-food program.He claimed, though, that Iraq can fend for itself: ``Iraq does notneed any humanitarian assistance. We are a rich country.''

===========Input: U.S. paratroopers parachute into northern Iraq, secure airfield, linkup with Kurdish militia IRBIL, Iraq (AP)Kurdish militiamen and U.S. special operations troops linked up withmore than 1,000 U.S. Army paratroopers Thursday to secure the areaaround a strategic air strip, as the first large coalition groundforce in northern Iraq began opening another front against SaddamHussein's regime.The Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade , including elite Army Rangers,jumped out of low-flying C-17 transport planes under cover ofdarkness Wednesday and secured a snow-dusted airfield, which will beused to bring in supplies and support personnel.The airdrop  _	one of the biggest paratroop drops in decades  _ wasa dramatic entry for ground troops into a region where only smallgroups of U.S. special forces have been operating. Coalitionairstrikes have been hitting Iraqi military forces and otherstrategic targets in the north.``This tightens the noose against Saddam's forces battling coalitionforces to the south,'' Brig. Gen. James Parker, commander of U.S.forces in the north. ``And it may also serve as a warning to Turkishforces.''Giving cover for the deployment, U.S. warplanes struck Iraqi groundtroops and bunkers in northern Iraq. Three waves of combat planesfrom the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt hit ``ground troops,command and control bunkers, artillery positions and ... a surface toair missile battery,'' said Lt. John Oliveira, the ship's publicaffair officer.Around dawn Thursday, strikes resumed, with a massive explosion justoutside the Kurdish zone close to the village of Kalak. Warplanespounded forward Iraqi positions in the hills overlooking Chamchamal,35 kilometers (22 miles) east of the key oil city of Kirkuk.Later Thursday, Kurdish troops in Chamchamal advanced their positionsbetween government-controlled and rebel-controlled areas, taking overa Iraqi check point on their front with no fighting at this point,witnesses said.Early Thursday, Kurdish fighters closed off a highway and roads nearthe airstrip where troops were said to be arriving, outside the townof Bashur, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of theKurd-controlled city of Irbil and 30 miles (50 kilometers) south ofthe Turkish border.From the highway, dusted from a recent snow, a flashing light fromthe airstrip's control tower was visible in the distance, and threehelicopters could be seen landing, flying with nearly all theirlights extinguished.Future airlifts into the area will include supplies and supportpersonnel for the 173rd's fighters, defense officials said. Theairfield's 6,700-foot (2,042-meter) runway is long enough to landC-17s and other U.S. military cargo planes.Lt. Col. Thomas Collins, a spokesman for the U.S. Army's SouthernEuropean Task Force, refused to say whether the paratroopers deployeddirectly from Italy into Iraq or had taken a different route.The matter immediately sparked controversy in Italy, where there is astrong anti-war movement. The country's parliament voted this monthto allow U.S.-led coalition forces to use Italian air space andmilitary bases	_  but not for directs attacks on Iraq.Pentagon officials have said for weeks they would have U.S. forces innorthern Iraq to open another front against Saddam's forces. The vastmajority of the coalition ground troops in Iraq are moving towardBaghdad from the south after entering from Kuwait.Pentagon officials had hoped to have the Army's 4th Infantry Divisioninvade Iraq from the north, but Turkey balked at allowing up to62,000 U.S. troops on its soil to prepare for that option. The use ofthe 173rd shows the military has shifted to a smaller, lighter force.Military officials say they would have liked to have secured key oilfields around the northern cities of Mosul and Kirkuk  _  and perhapsthe cities themselves  _  by now.Though no hostilities were expected during the deployment, the 173rddecided to parachute in rather then ferry troops in by plane so thata significant combat force could mass almost immediately to protectitself, officers said, according to a U.S. reporter traveling withthe 173rd.``Kirkuk is key. The Iraqi's want it, the Kurds want it, the Turkswant it and various other ethnic groups also want it,'' Maj. MikeHastings said. ``What this drop means is that we can secure it untilwe are relieved by other forces.''Besides Mosul and Kirkuk, another key target in northern Iraq isTikrit, Saddam's hometown and the tribal center for most of his innercircle. Most of the Adnan Division of the Republican Guard relocatedfrom the Mosul area to the Tikrit area shortly before the war began.Another key mission for the 173rd could be to keep order in northernIraq, which is controlled by two semi-autonomous Kurdish factions butalso includes several splinter groups and a base for theal-Qaida-linked Ansar al-Islam.Turkey has said it may send more troops into northern Iraq to preventrefugees from moving north, while U.S. officials have said theyadvised Turkey against sending large additional forces into northernIraq.

===========Input: U.S. troops push toward Baghdad's southern outskirts; capital plungedinto darkness after explosions SOUTH OF BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)U.S. soldiers moved to capture Baghdad's Saddam International Airportearly Friday and fought running battles with Iraqi defenders alongthe city's southern fringes. ``A vise is closing on the regime,''U.S. President George W. Bush said.Some frontline units went on heightened alert against the threat ofchemical weapons, ordered to wear rubber boots and suits despitetemperatures that soared into the 90s.There was fierce fighting in Kut, to the south of Baghdad, wheredesperate Iraqis armed with rifles charged tanks in a suicide raid.``We mowed down'' the attackers, said Lt. Col. B.P. McCoy.Despite declarations that more tough fighting lies ahead, the topU.S. military official indicated there may not be an all-out battlefor Baghdad. Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs ofStaff, suggested isolating members of the old regime in the capital _  cut off from the rest of the country  _  while an ``interimadministration'' is put in place to begin work on a postwargovernment.A meeting to organize an interim government could be held in Iraqwithin a week, a senior Pentagon official said Thursday night.For the first time in the war, large parts of Baghdad lostelectricity. The cause was not known. Myers told reporters at aPentagon briefing that Americans had not targeted the power grid.Tracer rounds lit the night sky and artillery boomed near the airporta few kilometers (miles) from the heart of President Saddam Hussein'scapital of 5 million people.At one stage, it appeared that U.S. forces had taken control of theairport, ``and then it got more confusing with continued fighting,Myers said Thursday night. Capture of the airport would give Americanand British troops a facility for airlifting equipment and troops toBaghdad.Along the city's southern edge, U.S. tanks and Bradley vehiclesdestroyed at least seven Iraqi armored personnel carriers and morethan 15 Iraqi tanks in fighting that went on for more than fourhours.Two weeks into the war, American commanders reported a string ofsuccesses  _  on the battlefield and within an Iraqi populationinitially reluctant about embracing invading troops. Kurdish fightersin the north chipped in, when a top leader suggested they may agreenot to seek control of the northern city of Kirkuk.There were battlefield setbacks, as well. Two Marines were killed andone injured in the close-quarters fighting in Kut. And an Armysoldier investigating a destroyed tank in central Iraq was killed byfriendly fire when he was mistaken for an Iraqi, the military said.U.S. defense officials also were investigating whether a Navy Hornetjet that crashed Wednesday was shot down by a U.S. Patriot missile.The Navy was searching for the pilot Thursday.The overall toll of American troops dead passed 50, and Bush visiteda Marine camp, which has lost 13  _  more than any otherinstallation. ``He's in heaven,'' the commander in chief told thefamily of one fallen Marine in a private moment.To the cheers of thousands earlier in a speech, he vowed victory, andsaid, ``A vise is closing on the regime.''Iraqi officials issued the latest in a series of exhortations inSaddam's name. ``Fight them with your hands. God will disgracethem,'' they said, referring to invading American and British troops.But the daily urgings seemed increasingly at odds with the militarysituation across the country, and Myers said Saddam had lost controlof 45 percent of Iraq's territory.As conventional units fought their way to the outskirts of thecapital, officials said special forces had raided the Thartharpresidential palace near Tikrit, Saddam's hometown. Documents wereseized at the site north of Baghdad, said Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooksat U.S. Central Command in the Persian Gulf, but no ranking membersof the regime were found.``That's all right, he added, ``there's other operations ongoing.''To the far north, U.S. special forces and Kurdish militiamen capturedthe town of Bardarash and a nearby bridge, one of few routes into thecity of Mosul near government-held oil fields. Iraqis had held thetown for 13 years.In the country's southern region, British forces penetrated closer tothe center of Basra, and warplanes dropped 500-pound (225-kilogram)and 1,000-pound (450-kilogram) laser-guided bombs on an Iraqiintelligence complex. Die-hard defenders have held out for daysinside the city of 1.3 million.American officials cited continuing examples of Iraqis cooperatingwith invading troops. In Najaf, they said a prominent cleric underhouse arrest by the Iraqi government had urged the population not tointerfere with the operations of American or British forces.A small group of Iraqi defenders has been holding out inside the cityin a mosque, considered a Shiite holy site, and local clerics saidone religious leader had recently arrived in hopes of arranging fortheir safe passage out of the shrine.Ground forces closed in on Baghdad from separate southern approaches,the Army from the southeast and Marines from the southwest, inadvances begun Tuesday night.American and British helicopters and planes bombed positions in Kut,and Marines and Iraqis lobbed grenades at close quarters.Between 10 and 15 Iraqis armed only with rifles charged Marine tanksin the suicide charge. Two U.S. Marines died in the fighting  _  anda medic who tried to save one of them sorrowfully buried hisresuscitation equipment on the spot.Army forces rolled past dozens of dead Iraqi soldiers and bombed-outhulks of Iraqi military equipment as they made their way towardBaghdad from the area around Karbala. Many more Iraqi soldierssurrendered to the overwhelming force of the Americans, and wereshuttled to the rear.At the same time they worried about chemical weapons attacks, Brooksdisclosed that a special operations force in the southwestern deserthad found a number of bottles ``marked in strange ways.'' He said aninvestigation was under way.

===========Input: Russia accepts World Bank loan to combat AIDS, tuberculosis MOSCOW (AP)Russia has accepted a US$150 million World Bank loan to combat thespread of AIDS and tuberculosis, ending a negotiating process thatlasted four years, World Bank officials said Friday.The World Bank first offered the loan in 1999, but disagreements overtreatment kept the project on hold. Russia objected to World Bankrules that required monitoring of patients receiving medication, theWorld Bank said.But after drawn-out talks, President Vladimir Putin signed off on theloan, which will take effect this year, the World Bank said.``Russia has one of the fastest growing AIDS epidemics in the world''and has a ``fearsome'' problem with tuberculosis, particularlydrug-resistant strains, said Olesoji Adeyi, a World Bank healthspecialist.``It's a potential dual epidemic,'' he said, adding that people withimmune systems weakened by the AIDS virus are especially vulnerableto contracting TB, which he called an ``opportunistic disease.''AIDS came relatively late to Russia, but spread rapidly, primarilydue to intravenous drug abuse and a lack of prevention programs.Officials have registered more than 230,000 cases of HIV, thoughhealth experts say the actual number of HIV infections tops 1million.Tuberculosis, meanwhile, has also emerged as a serious problem,particularly in Russia's overcrowded prisons.

===========Input: North Korea says Security Council's handling of nuclear issue is 'aprelude to war' SEOUL, South Korea (AP)North Korea on Sunday rejected the U.N. Security Council's plan todiscuss the standoff over its suspected nuclear weapons development,calling it ``a prelude to war.''Meanwhile, South Korean officials said Cabinet-level talks scheduledthis week between the two Koreas looked unlikely to take place. Seoulhad hoped to use the meeting to try to persuade its communistneighbor to scrap its nuclear ambitions.The Security Council is scheduled to discuss North Korea's nuclearprogram on Wednesday, and Pyongyang has said that any sanctionsimposed on it will be tantamount to war.The U.N. discussions are ``a grave provocation act intended toscuttle all (the North's) effort for dialogue and aggravate thesituation on the Korean Peninsula,'' a North Korean Foreign Ministryspokesman was quoted as saying by state-run news agency KCNA.The Security Council's ``handling of the nuclear issue on the KoreanPeninsula itself is precisely a prelude to war,'' the spokesman said.For months, North Korea has insisted on direct talks with the UnitedStates to negotiate a nonaggression treaty.Washington has refused, saying a multilateral solution to the crisiswas needed. The U.S. administration has been pressing the SecurityCouncil to adopt a statement condemning Pyongyang for failing to meetits obligations to prevent the spread of nuclear arms.But KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying that the U.S. invasion ofIraq showed that Washington was not bound by internationalagreements. A nonaggression treaty with Pyongyang would notnecessarily avert war because it may not be honored, he said.It was not immediately clear if Pyongyang would drop its demand for anonaggression pact.North Korea also said Washington is ``seriously mistaken'' if itthinks that the communist country will accept the U.S. demand todisarm. It said it will ignore any U.N. resolution on the nuclearissue.If the U.N. Security Council cooperates with U.S. efforts to``stifle'' North Korea, it would leave the North with ``no otheroption but to beef up the deterrent force for war by mobilizing allthe potentials,'' KCNA quoted the Foreign Ministry spokesman assaying.For weeks, North Korea has claimed that the United States plans toattack it after Iraq. Washington says it seeks a diplomatic end, buthas not ruled out a military solution.Last year, U.S. President George W. Bush said North Korea was part ofan ``axis of evil'' along with Iraq and Iran, and that it wasdeveloping weapons of mass destruction.South Korea has tried to keep a lid on rising tensions betweenWashington and Pyongyang.But officials in Seoul said Sunday that North Korea had yet toconfirm that Cabinet-level meetings scheduled to begin Monday inPyongyang would go ahead. Seoul had hoped to use the three-day talksto try to persuade its communist neighbor to scrap its suspectednuclear program in return for aid and better relations with theoutside world.North Korea called off two working-level talks with South Korea lastmonth.Also on Sunday, South Korean lawmakers said they would work toquickly set up a special parliamentary committee to deal with theNorth's nuclear issue.The nuclear standoff began in October, when U.S. officials said NorthKorea admitted having a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994agreement.

===========Input: URGENT U.S. tanks roll into heart of Baghdad and troops occupy keybuildings. NEAR BAGHDAD (AP)American troops stormed a presidential palace and other key buildingsin Baghdad as U.S. tanks rumbled into the heart of the battered Iraqicapital on Monday amid the thunder of gunfire and explosions.Buildings occupied by U.S. troops included Saddam Hussein's newestpresidential palace, the Information Ministry and the Al-RashidHotel. Reporters saw the tanks roll into the heart of Baghdad on thewestern side of the Tigris River, which divides the city.As U.S. columns moved northeast along the Tigris river, Iraqis fledalong its banks and some jumped in the water. An ammunition depotacross the river was on fire.More than 70 tanks and 60 Bradley armored vehicles were involved inthe blitz, military sources said.At the palace compound, Iraqis shot small arms fire from a clocktower, which the U.S. tanks quickly destroyed. Most of the compoundwas severely damaged from prior U.S. raids.Col. David Perkins, a brigade commander of the 3rd Infantry, told histroops before the operation that the mission was intended to be ``adramatic show of force'' to demonstrate that U.S. forces can enterBaghdad at any time, anywhere.``I hope this makes it clear to the Iraqi people that this (theregime) is over and that they can now enjoy their new freedom,''Perkins said.``I do believe this city is freakin' ours,'' said Capt. Chris Carter.Monday's incursion by U.S. armor was the second, but appeared to bemuch heavier. The first one was on Saturday and triggered intense gunbattles, which according to some U.S. accounts, left at least 2,000Iraqi fighters dead.Since coalition troops seized Baghdad's international airport, theyhave encircled the heavily-bombed city of 5 million people, blockingoff entry and exits and monitored all movement from the air.In a move weighted with symbolism and tactical importance, a hulkingU.S. C-130 transport plane flew into Baghdad's airport. The arrivalpresaged a major resupply effort by air for U.S. troops, dependentuntil now on a tenuous line stretching 550 kilometers (350 miles) toKuwait.Monday's advances came one day after British forces in the south madetheir deepest push into Iraq's second largest city.Gen. Peter Pace, vice chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,told CNN that U.S. forces drove though portions of the Iraqi capital,seizing Iraqi tanks and armored personnel carriers.U.S. officials have declared Baghdad cut off from the rest of Iraq.``We do control the highways in and out of the city and do have thecapability to interdict, to stop, to attack any Iraqi military forcesthat might try to either escape or to engage our forces,'' said Pace.Intense fighting over the weekend took a growing toll on combatantsand civilians. Injured Russian diplomats and a convoy of America'sKurdish comrades in arms were among unintended victims caught incrossfire and friendly fire Sunday. Kurds said 18 of their own diedin the mistaken U.S. air strike.Assorted prizes fell into allied hands, some after hard fighting, butU.S. forces had yet to confront Baghdad's last-ditch defenders on alarge scale.Inside a VIP building at the airport, troops found a lavish hideawaybelieved to have been used by Saddam, Associated Press TelevisionNews reported.Southeast of Baghdad, Marines seized one of Saddam's palaces andpoked through remnants of a Republican Guard headquarters.Also to the south, U.S. forces took control Sunday of the center ofthe holy city of Karbala, the Army Times newspaper reported from thescene.U.S. forces consolidated positions around Baghdad. Explosions wereheard throughout the night Sunday, and shortly before dawn on Monday,shaking downtown buildings.On another vital front, British troops thrust to the center of Basra,Iraq's second largest city, with a sense they were finally shakingSaddam loyalists loose.British Desert Rats went into the city of 1.3 million with more thanthree dozen tanks and armored cars, a column similar in size to theAmerican unit that probed suburban Baghdad. The British foundresistance softer than expected, picked up reports that the localBaath Party leadership was crumbling and fought into the core, losingat least three soldiers.``We have a lot of it occupied,'' British Maj. Gen. Peter Wall toldthe BBC. He said it might take days to put down renegades.The United States is deploying some of Iraq's exiles and internaldissidents around the country to help root out pro-Saddam elements,keep order and distribute aid, according to one such organization,the Iraq National Congress. The group said several hundred of itsmembers were flown to an area near the city of Nasiriyah.In northern Iraq, U.S. warplanes struck a convoy of allied Kurdishfighters and U.S. special forces Sunday in one of the deadliestfriendly fire attacks of the war. At least 18 people were killed andmore than 45 wounded, including senior Kurdish commanders, Kurdishofficials said.U.S. Central Command only reported one civilian killed and six peopleinjured, including a U.S. soldier, but its investigation was notcomplete.A convoy of Russian diplomats, including the ambassador, came underfire Sunday while evacuating Baghdad, the Russian foreign ministrysaid. A correspondent for state-run Russian television said theconvoy was caught in a crossfire and three diplomats were hurt, onewith a serious stomach wound.U.S. Central Command said no allied forces were operating in the areaat the time, but it was investigating what happened.

===========Input: U.S. troops tighten grip on capital, U.S. military criticized formedia casualties BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)U.S. forces tightened their grip throughout Baghdad, entering thecity for the first time from the north, seizing a military airportand battling snipers and Republican Guard fighters. Meanwhile, theU.S. military faced sharp criticism over assaults that killed threeforeign journalists.Pentagon officials said Tuesday they didn't know whether IraqiPresident Saddam Hussein died in the U.S. airstrike on a Baghdadneighborhood the day before. The strike destroyed three nearby housesand killed at least two people.U.S. Marines battled snipers as they fought deeper into the capitalfrom the east. They seized the Rasheed Airport and captured enoughammunition for an estimated 3,000 troops. Ominously, they also took aprison where they found U.S. Army uniforms and chemical weapons suitspossibly belonging to American POWs.Some army units routed Iraqi fighters from a Republican Guardheadquarters inside the capital. Others discovered a 12-room complexinside a cave, complete with white marble floors and fluorescentlighting.Members of the U.S. Army's V Corps opened up a new front by enteringBaghdad from the north.The toll on Iraqi civilians four days after Americans firstpenetrated the Baghdad outskirts is unknown. But the World HealthOrganization said Baghdad's hospitals were running out of supplies totreat the burns, shrapnel wounds and spinal injuries caused by thefighting.Iraqi officials, however, remained defiant, saying Iraq's forceswould never surrender to American forces: ``They will be burnt,''said Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf.In central Baghdad, a Reuters cameraman and a cameraman for Spain'sTelecinco died when an American tank fired on the Palestine Hotel.``The incident ... raises questions about the judgment of theadvancing U.S. troops who have known all along that this hotel is themain base for almost all foreign journalists in Baghdad,'' ReutersEditor-in-Chief Geert Linnebank said.Tareq Ayyoub, a journalist with Al-Jazeera, died when a U.S. warplanebombed the Arab-language satellite television's office. An Abu DhabiTV office in Baghdad also was hit.Al-Jazeera categorically denied that its Baghdad bureau had been usedby Iraqi forces to fire on U.S. troops. U.S. Central Command said itfired on the TV office and the hotel after U.S. forces came under``significant'' fire from those buildings.Associated Press photographer Jerome Delay said he watched from thetop floor of the hotel as American tanks took up positions on thebridge. ``All the shooting was concentrated on the bridge and acrossthe river,'' where U.S. forces were located, he said.It was not clear whether any Iraqi leader had been killed in theairstrike targeting Saddam in an upscale Baghdad neighborhood. Iraqirescue workers pulled two bodies from the rubble but said the tollcould be as high as 14.``I don't know whether he survived,'' U.S President George W. Bushsaid of Saddam at a joint news conference with British Prime MinisterTony Blair. ``The only thing I know is that he's losing power.''Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Mohammed Al-Douri, said Tuesday he believesthat Saddam is alive, although al-Douri acknowledged he has notcommunicated with Baghdad.Bush and Blair sought to minimize their differences over who shouldgovern and rebuild Iraq. Blair favors a stronger U.N. role than Bush.``There will be a vital role for the U.N. in the reconstruction ofIraq,'' Blair said. ``But the key is that Iraq in the end will be runby the Iraqi people.''In northern Iraq, Kurdish forces tightened their ring around Kirkukon Tuesday, following heavy coalition airstrikes on Iraqi fronts.Kurdish militia took control of Sekamian plateau, about 10 kilometers(six miles) north of Kirkuk, Kurdish media reported. The area affordsa commanding view of the city and the vast oil fields of Iraq's No. 2oil region.The U.S. military said two planes had been lost.An A-10 ``Warthog'' warplane was shot down near Baghdad, believed tobe the first fixed-wing aircraft downed by an Iraqi surface-to-airmissile since the war began. U.S. Central Command said the pilotejected, was recovered by ground forces and was in good condition.A U.S. F-15E jet fighter also went down early Monday and a search wasunder way for its two-man crew, the military announced Tuesday.Officials did not say whether the plane was shot down or crashedaccidentally.British forces in southern Iraq worked to restore order in theheavily looted streets of Basra, as desperate citizens swarmed watertanker trucks the day after British soldiers claimed Iraq's secondlargest city.British forces also began establishing the country's first postwaradministration Tuesday, granting a local sheik power to set up anadministrative committee representing the groups in the region.

===========Input: Iraq's U.N. ambassador meets Annan, won't discuss future plans UNITED NATIONS (AP)Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Mohammed Al-Douri, the first Iraqi official toconcede defeat in the U.S.-led war, met privately withSecretary-General Kofi Annan, but refused to talk about rumors thathe was planning to leave New York.``I am sorry,'' he said. ``No Answer.''``No comment at all. This is my last word to you,'' he told hordes ofjournalists who chased him Thursday at his New York residence andU.N. headquarters seeking comment on his talks with thesecretary-general, his future and the war.Asked who should govern Iraq, Al-Douri said: ``I have nothing to dowith that.''Annan also declined to comment on Thursday's meeting with Al-Douri.With the fall of Baghdad Wednesday, Al-Douri declared ``the game isover'' and expressed hope that the Iraqi people will now be able tolive in peace. He said he had not been in touch with Baghdad.Beside meeting with Annan, Al-Douri spent several hours during thelate morning and afternoon meeting with ambassadors and diplomats inthe Delegate's Lounge.``I wished him good luck but I don't know what he said to thesecretary-general and what will be his next steps,'' said Arab LeagueSecretary-General Amr Moussa, who talked with Al-Douri before his ownmeeting with Annan.In an interview with The Associated Press Wednesday night, Al-Dourisaid he will continue to work at the United Nations and had nointention of defecting.``Defecting from who?'' he asked. ``I think the government hasalready defected. There is no more Iraqi government to be defectedfrom.''Annan said early Thursday  _  before meeting Al-Douri  _  that intalks with the envoy Monday, ``he didn't ask for an asylum orprotection ... (and) he didn't ask me for help with his status.''``We did talk about what happens, depending on the evolution ofthings on the ground,'' Annan said.The ambassador had vehemently defended his country for months as theUnited States and its allies sought U.N. backing for war on Iraq.Privately, many U.N. diplomats see him as a respectable colleague.``I sympathize with his need to create a new life for himself,'' saidBritain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock.Al-Douri taught international law at Baghdad University for over 30years before becoming a diplomat in 1999, first at the United Nationsin Geneva and since early 2001 at U.N. headquarters in New York.He said in the AP interview he would love to return to teaching butfor now he plans to remain at the United Nations. ``Things will becrystalized one day,'' he said.``What I worried about is that things are settled in the country ...so in the future the Iraqi people will live in peace withoutsanctions, without wars, without suffering. This is my message.''Separately, lawyers who claim that Iraq helped plan the 1995 OklahomaCity bombing that killed 168 people asked a judge at a federal courtin New York to force Al-Douri to testify in the case and hold theenvoy in contempt, saying they worry that he would flee the country.But U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Al-Douri still has diplomaticimmunity as Iraq's ambassador. Under U.N. rules, a new Iraqigovernment would have to ask to represent the country, which theGeneral Assembly would then consider.``He is still Iraq's ambassador at the United Nations,'' White Housespokesman Ari Fleischer said in Washington. ``Legally, that is theway it works at the U.N.''Larry Klayman, chairman of Judicial Watch, which represent 14survivors and victims' relatives who have filed a $1.5 billionfederal lawsuit against Iraq in Washington, said his organization hadserved a subpoena on Al-Douri twice, on March 26 and March 28, butsaid he has not responded.U.S. District Judge John S. Martin did not immediately rule butscheduled a hearing for next week.The April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal buildingwas the deadliest terrorist strike on American soil at the time. Thesuit claims Iraqi officials provided money and training to convictedbomber Timothy McVeigh and conspirator Terry Nichols. McVeigh wasexecuted in 2001, and Nichols is serving a life sentence.

===========Input: Spurned by U.S. over human rights, Indonesia turns to Russia for arms JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP)The dictator Suharto has fallen, the constitution has changed, themedia was unshackled, democratic elections held, and East Timorfreed. After Sept. 11, 2001, Indonesia was quick to sign onto U.S.President George W. Bush's global war on terror.Yet, Washington maintains a 12-year ban on arms sales to the world'smost populous Muslim nation with the aim of curbing human rightsabuses still happening despite momentous political change.Frustrated, Jakarta's generals are looking elsewhere to replaceantiquated arsenals.Later this month Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri travelsto Moscow to seek the Kremlin's help in modernizing her increasinglyobsolete 300,000-member armed forces.She is also likely to open the way for Russian companies to vie forlucrative deals in the oil and gas sector, long dominated by Americanand British resource giants.Although opposite ends of the Earth, Indonesia and Russia have somebasic things in common.Both are geographically sprawling with massive multiethnicpopulations. Both are struggling to preserve national unity as theyfight separatism and build democracy after the collapse of decades ofauthoritarian rule.Both are resource-rich, but face huge economic problems made worse byendemic corruption. And, currently, both have opposed the U.S.- ledwar on Iraq.Indonesia's Foreign Ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa saysMegawati's meeting with Russian President Putin slated for April 21will touch on the Iraq crisis.But other diplomats say that issue will serve primarily to bring thetwo closer together on bottom-line issues such as trade and armssales.Analysts worry that Indonesia's military is now so degraded it can nolonger control the borders of the far-flung archipelago, allowing foreasy infiltration by extremists.Last year's Bali bombings, which killed 202 people, illustrated thethreat of terrorism in Indonesia. And, broad opposition to theU.S.-led attack on Iraq threatens to lead to a backlash by militantIslamists.``Nearly everybody in Indonesia sees this Iraq war as completelyunnecessary and there is widespread public opposition to U.S.policies,'' said Jusuf Wanadi of the Center for Strategic andInternational Studies in Jakarta.Close ties between Moscow and Jakarta are not unprecedented.Indonesia relied on Soviet military assistance in the 1950s underMegawati's father and founding President Sukarno, but these weresevered after the anti-communist Gen. Suharto seized power in 1965.The United States quickly became the Southeast Asian country's mainweapons supplier, and annual arms sales peaked at US$400 million inthe 1980s.In 1991, however, the U.S. Congress banned this after Indonesiantroops killed hundreds of civilians in East Timor.In 1999, East Timor became free, but only after Indonesian forceslaid waste to it as they withdrew after a pro-independencereferendum.The shocking level of destruction prompted U.S. lawmakers to expandthe ban to cover almost all military ties with Indonesia.Since then some in the Bush administration  _  particularly DeputyDefense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, a former ambassador to Jakarta anda prime architect of the Iraq war  _  have pushed for the ban to berepealed.So far, U.S. lawmakers have reinstated only a limited officertraining program. But that's far from enough for Indonesia'sgenerals.``I think the Indonesian military has finally decided thatrestrictions and conditionalities from Washington are just not worthit,'' said Juwono Sudarsono, a former defense minister. ``So theywant to look for alternative sources for planes, helicopters andother hardware.''Moscow has already had some success in wooing Indonesia as acustomer.Jakarta has recently purchased some Russian weapons, including 10,000Kalashnikov assault rifles, a squadron of naval Mil-2 helicopters anda dozen BTR-80A amphibious carriers for its marines.Currently, Indonesia uses short-range Rapier missiles purchased 30years ago to protect its vital oil and natural gas fields in Sumatra,Borneo and Papua from air attack.``Replenishing them has been a big problem,'' Sudarsono said.Air defense commanders want to augment the Rapiers with Russia'simpressive long-range S-300 missiles, or shorter-range systems suchas the SA-15 Gauntlet or shoulder-fired Igla.The Air Force is reportedly considering purchasing several squadronsof Sukhoi Su-27 interceptors, considered the world's premierdogfighters.Previously, Indonesian Air Force commanders preferred Western jetsthat were compatible with the U.S.-made F-16 fighter-bombers alreadyin the Indonesian inventory. But neighboring Malaysia's success inintegrating Russian MiG-29s and American F/A-18 Hornets persuadedthem otherwise, Sudarsono said.If Megawati does stiff-arm the United States on the weapons issue, itis unlikely relations with Washington will be permanently damaged.Whatever happens, Indonesia, a mainly Muslim but politically secularstate, is natural ally in the struggle against terrorism andreligious militancy.What could be more worrying for Washington is Russia's economicambitions.Trade between Indonesia and Russia increased by dlrs 36.2 million todlrs 203.5 million in 2001  _  the last year for which statistics areavailable. Analysts say this can only grow.The real concerns, though, are in the petroleum sector.Megawati and Putin are expected to sign agreements to give Russiancompanies a toehold in Indonesia's oil and gas industry, longdominated by American and British giants such as Exxon Mobil and BP.

===========Input: Czech nuclear plant gets permission to produce at full capacity PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP)The troubled nuclear power plant in Temelin received permission fromstate authorities Monday to start power production at full capacity.Pavel Pitterman, the spokesman for the State Office for NuclearSafety, said his office gave the plant permission to run its second,newer 1,000-megawatt unit at full capacity. The plant's first1,000-megawatt unit has already operated at full capacity during pasttests.The spokesman for the Temelin plant, Milan Nebesar, said that an18-month trial production at full capacity at the second unit, neededto declare the unit ready for commercial production, would startFriday.The plant, based on Russian design and upgraded with U.S. technology,has been plagued by frequent, non-nuclear malfunctions since testingbegan in November 2000.Located just 60 kilometers (35 miles) north of the Austrian border,it has been a source of friction between the two countries.Critics in non-nuclear Austria argue the plant is unsafe and demandthat it be shut down, but Czech authorities insist the plant is safe.The plant's first unit, currently shut down for planned maintenancescheduled to take two months, has already entered the last stage oftests and should be ready for commercial use at the end of 2003.

===========Input: U.S. and Iraqis look to form new government, but some groups boycottmeeting UR, Iraq (AP)A U.S.-sponsored forum that brought Iraqi opposition leaders togetherto shape the country's postwar government began Tuesday with a U.S.promise not to rule Iraq and concluded with an agreement to meetagain in 10 days.Meeting in the biblical birthplace of the prophet Abraham, delegatesfrom Iraq's many factions discussed the role of religion in thefuture government and ways to rebuild the country. But some ShiiteMuslim groups boycotted the meeting and thousands protested nearby.A 13-point statement released after the meeting stressed the need towork toward a democratic Iraq built on the rule of law and equality.It also called for dissolving Saddam's Baath Party but left open thequestion of separating church from the state.Retired Lt. Gen. Jay Garner, who will head the U.S.-led interimadministration in Iraq, opened the conference under a golden-coloredtent in the shadows of the 4,000-year-old ziggurat at Ur, a terracedtemple platform of the ancient Sumerians.``What better birthday can a man have than to begin it not only wherecivilization began but where a free Iraq and a democratic Iraq willbegin today?'' said Garner, who turned 65 Tuesday and wore a twinAmerican and Iraqi flag pin on his blue shirt.White House envoy Zalmay Khalilzad told delegates that the UnitedStates has ``no interest, absolutely no interest, in ruling Iraq.''``We want you to establish your own democratic system based on Iraqitraditions and values,'' Khalilzad said. ``I urge you to take thisopportunity to cooperate with each other.''Participants included Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites from inside thecountry and others who spent years in exile. U.S. officials invitedthe groups, which picked their own representatives.Many Iraqis boycotted the meeting in opposition to U.S. plans toinstall Garner atop an interim administration. Thousands of Shiites _  who constitute Iraq's most populous religious group but wererepressed under Saddam Hussein	_  demonstrated in nearby Nasiriyah,chanting ``No to America and no to Saddam!''``Iraq needs an Iraqi interim government. Anything other than thistramples the rights of the Iraqi people and will be a return to theera of colonization,'' said Abdul Aziz Hakim, a leader of the largestIraqi Shiite group, the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution inIraq.U.S. officials hope more Iraqis join the process and stressed thatthis was just the first of many such meetings in Iraq. The meetingconcluded with the delegates voting by show of hands to meet again in10 days.A national conference is planned to select the interimadministration, perhaps within weeks, a senior U.S. official said oncondition of anonymity.The interim administration could begin handing power back to Iraqiofficials within three to six months, but forming a government willtake longer, said Maj. Gen. Tim Cross, the top British member ofGarner's team.``One has to go through the process of building from the bottom up,allowing the leadership to establish itself, and then the electionprocess to go through and so forth,'' Cross said. ``That fullelectoral process may well take longer.''Garner's Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance ischarged with coordinating humanitarian assistance, rebuildinginfrastructure shattered by years of war and U.N. sanctions, andgradually handing back power to Iraqis leading a democraticallyelected government.Tuesday's meeting was the first step toward that goal after theouster of Saddam.Sheik Ayad Jamal Al Din, a Shiite religious leader from Nasiriyah,urged the delegates to craft a secular government, according to apool report. But Nassar Hussein Musawi, a schoolteacher, disagreed:``Those who would like to separate religion from the state are simplydreaming,'' he said.Iraqi exile Hatem Mukhliss quoted President John F. Kennedy'sexhortation, ``Ask not what your country can do for you, but what youcan do for your country,'' and called on Iraqis to write aconstitution, establish a legal system and consider what role thearmy should play.He asked coalition representatives to address problems of security,electricity and water in Iraq and help rebuild destroyed and lootedhospitals.``Saddam reduced the country to such a state that it was necessaryfor people to sell off personal possessions,'' Mukhliss said. ``Nowit's time to take our country back.''There are already tensions between the United States and some Iraqifactions.Kurdish groups appear unwilling to compromise on their demand toexpand the border of their autonomous area to include the oil-richcity of Kirkuk and Kurdish parts of the city of Mosul.That could pose a problem for the United States, because Turkeyworries that Kurdish control of Kirkuk could lead to aspirations forindependence and in turn encourage separatist Kurds in Turkey.Iraqi opposition leaders fear the United States is trying to forceAhmed Chalabi, head of the London-based umbrella Iraqi NationalCongress, on them as leader of a new Iraqi administration.Chalabi was the first top Iraqi opposition leader to be airlifted bythe U.S. military into southern Iraq as the fighting wound down, andhe and other top members of his group plan to meet soon in Baghdad.U.S. officials said Chalabi was brought in because he offered forcesto the coalition.Neither Chalabi nor many other leaders of anti-Saddam groups attendedTuesday's meeting, but they sent delegates.Iraqis protesting the conference said it did not represent theirinterests. The protesters held banners written in English and Arabicsaying the ``Hawza,'' or the Shiite religious seminary in Najaf,represents them.Even some of those at the meeting said they did not want Garnerleading the interim administration.``We will press for any Iraqi civilian administration regardless ofwhat the Americans say. An administration by Garner is notacceptable,'' said Mowaffak al-Rubaie, an Iraqi physician andopposition activist.He said American officials have outlined what Garner's administrationwould look like: Each ministry would be headed by an American, eithermilitary or civilian. Each minister would have two American deputiesand eight American advisers, plus four Iraqi advisers from inside thecountry and four Iraqi exiles.	     _  _  _  =Associated Press writer Patrick McDowell in Kuwait City contributedto this report.

===========Input: Appeal launched against Russian journalist's treason conviction MOSCOW (AP)The lawyer for a Russian military journalist convicted of treasonfiled an appeal Wednesday in an effort to overturn the guilty verdictagainst his client, who was released on parole earlier this year,news agencies reported.Grigory Pasko's lawyer Genri Reznik filed the appeal with RussianSupreme Court, the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies reported. Heasked the court to invalidate the verdict and throw out the criminalcase against Pasko, they said.Pasko was sentenced to four years in prison in December 2001 forillegally attending a meeting of top military commanders and takingnotes there. A military court said he intended to pass the notes toJapanese media with which he had worked.Pasko, whose sentence included time served, was released in Januaryfor good behavior after serving more than two-thirds of the sentence.He has maintained his innocence, saying the military was punishinghim for exposing environmental abuses by the Russian navy, includingthe dumping of radioactive waste into the sea.Reznik said an initial appeal he lodged the day Pasko was freed neverreached the presidium of the Supreme Court, according to Interfax.The lawyer said the court's military board had refused to launchproceedings on the appeal.Reznik said he addressed the new appeal directly to Supreme CourtChairman Vyacheslav Lebedev and asked that it not be considered bymilitary judges ``because the military justice system has adopted abiased attitude against Pasko,'' Interfax reported.(sbg)

===========Input: U.S. troops capture Saddam's half brother, stop major bank robbery incapital BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)American commandos captured a half brother of Saddam Hussein onThursday, the latest success in a campaign to round up insiders fromthe former regime. U.S. troops thwarted a Baghdad bank robbery overthe protests of Iraqis eager to share in the loot.As U.S. forces struggled to restore order in Iraq, FBI DirectorRobert Mueller announced that agents had been detailed to helprecover antiquities looted from museums in Baghdad and elsewhere.Agents will aid international efforts to recover stolen items ``onboth the open and black markets,'' he said.With the fighting all but over, the USS Constellation steamed fromthe Persian Gulf for its home port, carrying dozens of warplanes nolonger needed. It was the second aircraft carrier ordered home inrecent days.The U.S. military's search for chemical and biological weapons isunlikely to succeed until Iraqis lead American forces to them,Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Thursday.``I don't think we'll discover anything, myself,'' Rumsfeld said at ameeting with Pentagon employees. ``I think what will happen is we'lldiscover people who will tell us where to go find it.''U.S. troops have found suspicious chemicals and facilities at anumber of sites but tests on the materials have proved negative orinconclusive. Eliminating such weapons was a chief reason PresidentGeorge W. Bush gave for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that beganMarch 20.Brig. Gen. Vincent Brooks announced the capture of Barzan IbrahimHasan al-Tikriti, telling reporters he was an adviser to Saddam``with extensive knowledge of the regime's inner workings.''A U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity,said Barzan Ibrahim had been a presidential adviser to Saddam'sregime since 1998, but had a shaky relationship with his half brotherand was not part of the regime's inner circle.He was a representative to the United Nations in Geneva from 1989 to1998. Earlier, from 1979 to 1983, he headed Iraq's Mukhabarat, orintelligence service, a period when the organization arrangedexecutions of regime opponents in Iraq and overseas, the officialsaid.Brooks provided scant details of the operation that netted BarzanIbrahim, saying he was taken inside Baghdad and that U.S. specialforces were aided by Marines. He said there were no casualties.Another of Saddam's three half brothers, Watban Ibrahim Hasanal-Tikriti, was captured earlier by U.S. forces. The third has notbeen found.American forces have been criticized for failing to stop looting inseveral Baghdad cities, and there have been complaints, as well, thathumanitarian relief has been slow in arriving.But Marines foiled a brazen act of lawlessness during the day whenthey interrupted a robbery-in-progress at a branch of the al-RashidBank and took away US$4 million for safekeeping.Thieves had blown a hole in the vault and dropped children in tobring out fistfuls of cash. As word spread that the robbery was underway, Iraqis gathered, saying they had accounts at the branch, and ariot broke out.Marines broke it up  _	over the protests of Iraqis not involved inthe robbery  _	and the thieves were arrested.``These people want the money and they believe it is rightfully theirmoney, but they don't understand that the proper distribution is notfirst-come, first-served,'' said Col. Philip DeCamp, a battalioncommander.Gen. Tommy Franks, the commander of Operation Iraqi Freedom, toldreporters during a visit to Kuwait that ``the looting goes down everyday and I think you will continue to see it go down because theIraqis are now stepping up and controlling the problems forthemselves.''There was evidence of slow progress. Baghdad residents gatheredoutside the city's police academy when word spread that some of thecars looted in recent days had been recovered.Still, more than a week after the regime collapsed, Marine Staff Sgt.Jose Guillen said power has been restored  _  by use of diesel plants _  to only about 500 homes in Baghdad, a city of roughly 5 million.He said U.S. forces expect to get one of the city's power grids online by Friday.Unrest continued in other parts of the country. Americans sought tobring calm to Mosul, where U.S. troops killed 17 people in clashesearlier in the week.Brooks, briefing reporters at the U.S. Central Command headquarters,also disclosed that Marines had broken up violent clashes onWednesday in Tikrit, Saddam's hometown. The fighting broke outbetween club-wielding members of the former ruler's clan and a rivalgroup, he said.Clan rivalries aside, there are numerous other resentments shapingevents in the post-Saddam era. Majority Shiite Muslims are eager forpower after decades of Saddam favoring Sunni Muslims, for example.And Kurds are eager to claim what they say Saddam took from them andgave to Arabs in the northern part of the country.International experts, appalled at the looting of Iraqi historicalartifacts, met in Paris under U.N. auspices and called for atemporary embargo on Iraqi cultural objects.Some of the participants at the meeting said it appeared the lootingwas organized, and some of those involved had keys to museum vaultsand were able to remove items from safes.One suggested the effort was organized from outside Iraq.``It looks as if part of the looting was a deliberate plannedaction,'' said McGuire Gibson, a University of Chicago professor andpresident of the American Association for Research in Baghdad.``I have a suspicion it was organized outside the country, in factI'm pretty sure it was,'' Gibson said. He added that if a good policeteam was put together, ``I think it could be cracked in no time.''The Baghdad museum housed irreplaceable Babylonian, Sumerian andAssyrian collections that chronicled ancient life in the cradle ofcivilization, the area around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.

===========Input: Malaysian court rejects Anwar's appeal against sodomy conviction KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)Malaysia's second highest court on Friday rejected an appeal byjailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim against hisconviction and nine-year prison sentence for sodomy.A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals unanimously upheld averdict by High Court Judge Arifin Jaka nearly three years ago thatfound Anwar guilty of sodomizing his wife's former driver. Sodomy isa crime in this predominantly Muslim Southeast Asian country.Anwar is expected to appeal again with the Federal Court, Malaysia'shighest court.Speaking to reporters after the verdict, Anwar lambasted the judges,saying they had been ``preselected'' by the government to quash hisappeal.``These are spineless judges,'' Anwar said. ``This decision is allscripted.''The judges also rejected an application by Anwar to be released onbail. But Anwar's lawyers said they were filing a fresh request forbail pending a further appeal.On Monday, Anwar completed his sentence for a separate conviction oncorruption charges, after the six-year sentence was reduced byone-third for good behavior. He then began serving the nine-yearprison sentence for sodomy, his lawyers said.Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, his former protege, in1998 following disputes over financial policy. Anwar led largeprotests against Mahathir before he was arrested, charged andconvicted on corruption and sodomy charges.Anwar claims the charges were fabricated to keep him from challengingMahathir for power. The government denies this.Human rights group Amnesty International said Friday's verdict``represents another step in the further deterioration in the humanrights situation in the country.''``This decision adds to the already widespread perception that inpolitically sensitive cases, the independence of the judiciary can nolonger be guaranteed,'' the London-based group said in a statement.``Today, the situation looks much bleaker.''Param Cumaraswamy, the U.N. special investigator on the freedom ofjudges and lawyers, said in a statement: ``So long as there arejudges who are prepared to and continue to compromise the value andprinciples of their high office ... there is no hope for judicialindependence and impartiality in the Malaysian justice system.''About 200 demonstrators outside the court shouted Anwar's slogan of``Reformasi!'' for political change. Police armed with automaticweapons stood by to prevent rowdiness.The court also dismissed a joint appeal by Anwar's adopted brother,Sukma Darmawan, who was convicted together with Anwar for sodomy inAugust 2000 and sentenced to six years in jail and whipping.Sukma has been free on bail pending appeal, but the judges on Fridayordered him to begin his sentence.

===========Input: France proposes suspending U.N. sanctions against Iraq, a step towardU.S. goal UNITED NATIONS (AP)France on Tuesday proposed immediately suspending U.N. sanctionstargeting Iraq civilians, an important step toward the U.S. goal ofending trade embargoes that have crippled the country's economy.The surprise move by France, which led opposition to the U.S. waragainst Iraq, followed last week's call by U.S. President George W.Bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly, so Iraq can trade freely andits oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction.France's U.N. ambassador, Jean-Marc de La Sabliere, made the proposalat a Security Council meeting where members heard a briefing by chiefU.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix and for the first time exchangedviews on potentially divisive postwar issues.The proposal would end the U.N. ban on trade and investment in Iraqwhile leaving a 12-year-old arms embargo in place.The Security Council imposed sanctions after Iraq's 1990 invasion ofKuwait. Under council resolutions, sanctions cannot be lifted untilU.N. inspectors certify that Iraq's nuclear, chemical and biologicalweapons have been destroyed along with the long-range missiles todeliver them.Along with France, Russia, Germany and China also strongly opposedthe war. But de La Sabliere said before the meeting that SecurityCouncil ``must take into account the new realities on the ground.''Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov had said his country is ``not at allopposed to the lifting of sanctions.'' But he said Russia wants U.N.inspectors to certify that Iraq has been disarmed of all weapons ofmass destruction, as required under U.N. resolutions.Asked about the French proposal, he said: ``We are ready to discussit.''At another closed-door council meeting later Tuesday, the council wasto hear from Benon Sevan, head of the U.N. oil-for-food program,which had been providing food for 60 percent of Iraq's 24 millionpeople.France's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council phaseout the oil-for-food program, which allowed Iraq to sell unlimitedquantities of oil provided the money went for humanitarian goods andcompensation to victims of the first Gulf War.``There should be some adjustment with a view of a phasing out ofthis program,'' de La Sabliere said.This is one of the difficult decisions the council will face in theweeks ahead on divisive issues stemming from the war against Iraq.These include not only Iraq's disarmament and the future of sanctionsbut the U.N. role in Iraq now that the fighting is over, control ofIraq's oil revenue, and lucrative reconstruction contracts.Blix stressed that council resolutions call for U.N. inspectors tohave access to all sites and people in Iraq. He said he told thecouncil that he believes the world would like Iraq's disarmamentconfirmed by an international body that has been involved in thecountry for over 10 years.The Bush administration, which accused Blix of hindering its drivefor international support for the war, has already sent its own teamsto Iraq to search for illegal weapons.``At the moment, the coalition has assumed the responsibilities fordisarming Iraq,'' U.S. Ambassador John Negroponte, said Tuesday whenasked whether U.S. teams would work with U.N. inspectors.He said important scientists had turned themselves in, and theatmosphere had changed which should enable any Iraqi ``to speak morefreely and speak without fear of retribution to those who are askingthem the questions.''France's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council ``findpractical and pragmatic arrangements'' to coordinate and combine thework of the American teams and the work of U.N. inspectors ``so thatthe Iraqi disarmament could be internationally verified.''He told The Associated Press he envisioned sanctions being suspended``for a couple of months,'' and possibly renewed. He also envisionedU.S. and U.N. inspectors working together. ``And then sanctions couldbe lifted when a legitimate Iraqi government is in place,'' he said.In an interview with BBC radio aired Tuesday, Blix said that beforethe war, the U.S. and Britain appeared to have used ``shaky''intelligence, including forged documents, in an effort to prove Iraqhad banned weapons.Blix said it was ``very, very disturbing'' that U.S. intelligencefailed to identify as fakes documents suggesting Iraq tried to buyuranium from the West African nation of Niger. He told reporters atthe United Nations on Tuesday that the contract about ``yellow cake''uranium ``was more than shaky, it was a fake.''U.N. inspectors went back to Iraq for the first time in four years inlate November and discovered no weapons of mass destruction during 3{months of searching. Secretary-General Kofi Annan ordered all U.N.international staff, including the inspectors, to leave Iraq justbefore the war began on March 20. He has said he expects them toreturn.Annan also said Tuesday in Austria that Iraqis should be in charge oftheir own future and natural resources. He acknowledged that ``theU.N. is being challenged'' but said he expected an agreement on theU.N. role in Iraq in the ``not too distant future.''

Those companiescan subcontract to any company they want,'' Elizabeth Jones said.She made the statements after a meeting with the speaker of thePortuguese parliament, Joao Mota Amaral.``The U.S. government has done what it is going to do: it has openedup the process to international companies. We can't directcommerce,'' Jones said. ``Once it's a commercial proposition, theninternational bidding processes come into effect.''Jones met with Defense Minister Paulo Portas on Tuesday and will meetForeign Minister Antonio Martins da Cruz before leaving PortugalWednesday.About 50 Portuguese companies - mostly in the construction sector  _ are applying for subcontracts to help rebuild Iraq, Portuguese mediareported. Many are hoping to reap benefits from Portuguese governmentsupport of the U.S.-led war to oust Saddam Hussein.Also, Portugal hosted a last ditch pre-war summit in the Azoresislands for leaders of the United States, Britain and Spain.

North Korea also hinted during the meetingsthat they have nuclear weapons and may conduct a test, a U.S.official said.Earlier, Secretary of State Colin Powell had told a gathering ofexperts from the Asia-Pacific region that the talks had concluded,leaving the impression there would not be a third day of discussionson Friday.Powell also expressed hope that South Korea and Japan will be able toparticipate ``when and if'' there is another round of talks.``North Korea should not leave the meetings having the slightestimpression that they might force us to make a concession we would nototherwise make,'' he added.But U.S. State Department officials, asking not to be identified,said there may be more meetings on Friday. They said reports of abreakdown in the talks were a ``misrepresentation.''One official said: ``We had the opportunity to say what we needed tosay and to hear what the North Koreans wanted to tell us.''A U.S. official said the North Koreans implied during the talks thatthey have nuclear weapons and that they may conduct a test. But theofficial said there are no indications a test is imminent. Heacknowledged that preparations for an underground test could beconcealed.According to the official, a North Korean nuclear detonation woulddeplete by half their estimated stockpile of two weapons.In Beijing, chief U.S. negotiator, Assistant Secretary of State JamesKelly, declined to answer questions, saying only the sides ``hadtalks.''Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao refused to providedetails, but said the talks were ``conducive to mutual understandingand finding ways to resolve the North Korean nuclear questionpeacefully.''Discussions were scheduled to end Friday, when Kelly was to fly toSeoul the same day to meet with South Korean officials.The talks are the first high-level U.S.-North Korean contact sincetensions over the North's nuclear program spiked six months ago overWashington's claim that the North said in October it was trying todevelop nuclear weapons in violation of a 1994 pledge. The North hasdisputed the U.S. claim.Washington and its allies suspended fuel shipments to North Korea aspunishment. The North retaliated by withdrawing from the nuclearNon-Proliferation Treaty, expelling U.N. inspectors and restarting aplutonium-producing reactor.North Korea, which is seeking a guarantee from the United States thatit won't be attacked, ratcheted up the threat of conflict in astatement issued by its official Korean Central News Agency accusingWashington of escalating tensions.The North's leaders fear they could be the next target for U.S.military action.``The situation on the Korean Peninsula is so tense that a war maybreak out any moment due to the U.S. moves,'' the KCNA statementsaid.It said relations with the United States had hit ``rock bottom''because U.S. President George W. Bush named North Korea as part of an``axis of evil,'' along with Iran and Iraq.KCNA said the war in Iraq had shown the only way for a country toprotect itself was to have a strong military deterrent. Officialsfrom Seoul and Washington say the swift U.S.-led victory in Iraqprompted North Korea to agree to the nuclear talks.North Korea said the ``master key'' for successful talks was for theUnited States to drop its hostile policy toward Pyongyang.In a likely reference to North Korea's demand for a nonaggressiontreaty with Washington, KCNA said: ``The U.S. should settle the talksfrom a sincere stand and strive to settle the essential issue.''Washington has refused to offer a formal treaty but says it wouldconsider some sort of written assurance.The North also likely wants aid for its economy, which has beencrippled by the loss of Soviet subsidies and years of drought andmismanagement.North Korea and China fought against the United States in the 1950-53Korean War, which ended without a peace treaty. North Korea andWashington have no formal relations and are still technically at war.China, the North's ally and major aid donor, says it doesn't wantPyongyang to acquire nuclear weapons and has appealed for anegotiated settlement to the crisis.A U.S. official praised the Chinese contribution to the discussions.He said China's delegate specifically called for a denuclearizedKorean Peninsula and made specific reference to a 1992 promisePyongyang made to South Korea not to develop nuclear weapons.Ri Gun, deputy director of American affairs for North Korea's ForeignMinistry is representing North Korea at the talks. China's delegationis led by Fu Ying, director general of the Asian Affairs Departmentof its Foreign Ministry.

===========Input: Rudolph Giuliani, Judith Nathan to marry May 24 at Gracie Mansion NEW YORK (AP)Rudolph Giuliani will wed his companion, Judith Nathan, on May 24 inthe ex-mayor's old home, Gracie Mansion.The news was announced Thursday by Giuliani spokeswoman Sunny Mindel.His successor, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, will perform the ceremony.Giuliani, 58, proposed to Nathan, a former nurse, during a Novemberbusiness trip to Paris	_  five months after he finalized his divorcefrom Donna Hanover after 20 years of marriage.In interviews last year, Giuliani said Nathan gave him ``tremendousemotional support'' through his treatment for prostate cancer and ashe led the city during the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attackon the World Trade Center.``We were close already,'' Giuliani said. ``And then we went throughhell together.''Giuliani and Nathan began appearing in public together in May 2000.Soon after, he announced that he and Hanover were moving toward legalseparation.During the legal proceedings leading up to the divorce, a judge ruledthat Nathan could not visit Gracie Mansion, the official mayoralresidence, as long as Giuliani's children lived there.Giuliani and Hanover have two teenage children, Andrew and Caroline.The divorce settlement called for Giuliani to pay Hanover more than$6.8 million.Hanover, 53, is host of a syndicated television show, ``Famous Homesand Hideaways.'' Last month, she and her fiance  _  an old highschool sweetheart  _  invited the press along as they went shoppingfor wedding bands, saying they are planning a wedding in the New YorkCity area this summer.Giuliani's first marriage to his second cousin, Regina Peruggi,lasted about 14 years.

===========Input: Report: Accident on Chinese submarine kills all 70 aboard BEIJING (AP)An accident on a diesel-powered Chinese submarine has killed all 70officers and sailors aboard, the official Xinhua News Agency reportedFriday.The accident occurred ``recently'' in Chinese waters east of theNeichangshan islands, the brief Chinese-language report said. Theislands are in the Yellow Sea, between the northeastern province ofLiaoning and North Korea.The submarine was on an exercise when the accident occurred, and``because of a mechanical malfunction, the 70 crew members on boarddied,'' the Xinhua report said. It did not give further details orsay how the crew died.The vessel already has been towed back to an unidentified port,Xinhua said. It said the hull number was 361, which military analystssaid appeared to make it a Ming-class submarine, a vessel used forpatrols and coastal defense.The announcement was unusual for a communist government that rarelyacknowledges military accidents.It was the first time China has announced a fatal submarine mishap,said Bernard Cole, a professor at the U.N. National War College inWashington and a specialist on the Chinese navy.``There have been rumors going around about the loss of submarines,but this is the first fatal accident that I know of,'' said Cole.China's military, which has a tradition of secrecy, did not commentabout the accident Friday night.Foreign military analysts said it would be highly unusual for anaccident to kill a whole submarine crew while still allowing thevessel to be recovered. They suggested possible causes ranging from asinking in shallow water to a disaster that flooded the vessel withtoxic chemical fumes.Michael McGinty, an expert on the Chinese navy from the Royal UnitedServices Institute for Defense Studies in London, said that themishap likely happened while the submarine was on the surface. If theaccident happened when the vessel was underwater, it was less likelythat China could have recovered it, said McGinty, a former Britishsubmariner.``For an accident to have been so catastrophic when the submarine wason the surface, I find it a very mysterious thing,'' he said.McGinty said that the submarine's batteries might have leaked acidthat mixed with seawater, creating toxic chlorine gas that killed thecrew. The torpedoes might have leaked propellant that poisoned thecrew, he said.The accident could have occurred as long ago as March, said Cole, aformer U.S. Navy antisubmarine warfare officer.``There have been exercises going on in the Yellow Sea over the pasttwo months,'' he said. ``This boat could have been involved in thoseexercises and gone down over a month ago.''Cole said the loss of all hands suggested the vessel was flooded orsank because of a collision or engineering problem. He saidMing-class subs usually carry a crew of 50, suggesting that theothers aboard might have been technicians or staff officers.China began building the Ming-class subs in the 1970s, and they areobsolete by modern standards, according to the Federation of AmericanScientists.The first three Ming-class subs were completed between 1971 and 1979,and one of them was scrapped after a fire, according to the Web siteof Jane's Information Group, a leading of source defense information.China is believed to have as many as 19 Ming-class submarines.China's submarine fleet includes 66 boats, most of them agingdiesel-electric vessels, McGinty said. He said the fleet suffers froma chronic lack of money, training and maintenance.But the Chinese are aggressively updating their fleet withRussian-made Kilo-class diesel-electric subs.``The submarine force is the most potent part of the Chinese navy,''said Cole.Despite the difficulty of maintaining a fleet, subs are valuablebecause they are hard to detect, Cole said. In a conflict over Taiwanor some other confrontation, he said, ``China's ability to field aforce of even a dozen submarines could pose a big problem for anyother naval force.''Xinhua said former President Jiang Zemin, who is chairman of thecommission that runs China's military, on Friday sent condolences tofamily members of the crew.

===========Input: U.S., Britain drafting resolution limiting U.N. role in Iraq tohumanitarian relief LONDON (AP)The United States and Britain are preparing a resolution that wouldgive the United Nations a role in humanitarian relief but notpeacekeeping in Iraq, a senior official in U.S. President George W.Bush's administration said Friday.Separately, the United States has decided to divide the military andhumanitarian relief mission in Iraq into three parts under American,British and Polish command, the official said, speaking on conditionof anonymity. Six European countries have agreed to contribute troopsto the British and Polish sectors to create an internationalstability force, the official said.The draft resolution would limit the U.N. role to helping withrefugees and displaced people, reconstruction and humanitarianassistance, the official said. The United States and Britain agree onall but a few of the fine details of the resolution, the officialsaid, though there is no timetable on when it would be introduced.U.N. officials are already in Iraq providing humanitarian relief.U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said this week that the body has nointerest in policing a postwar Iraq, although it could contribute tothe political resuscitation of the country.``Take the question of security. I don't think the U.N. would want totake on that,'' Annan said. ``There has been a suggestion that theU.N. wanted to take over the whole Iraq and run it, which was alsonot the case.'' What the United Nations could contribute beyondhumanitarian assistance was ``political facilitation,'' Annan said.The proposed draft resolution would probably face resistance fromother U.N. Security Council members who have favored a U.N.-convenedconference of the kind that helped establish Afghanistan'spost-Taliban government.U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld discussed the resolutionwith Prime Minister Tony Blair and Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon onFriday as Rumsfeld returned from a tour of Iraq, Afghanistan and thePersian Gulf region. Rumsfeld said afterward he hoped the U.N. wouldplay a role but did not publicly discuss the draft resolutionoutlining that role.Hoon, who joined Rumsfeld in a news conference at Heathrow airport,also did not mention the draft resolution.``We are right to be optimistic about the way forward'' in Iraq, Hoonsaid.International stability forces will be sent to Iraq as soon aspossible, the U.S. official said, though it was unclear when thatwould be. Those troops will work to restore and maintain order andsupervise humanitarian projects such as the restoration of water andelectricity and delivery of food and medical aid.The six nations contributing troops are Italy, Spain, Ukraine,Denmark, the Netherlands and Bulgaria, the official said.Representatives of those countries will meet with British officialsMay 7 and Polish officials May 22 to determine what forces eachcountry will contribute and whether they will be put under British orPolish command.The U.S. part of the stability force will be comprised of Americantroops. While that portion is likely to consist of a militarydivision  _  about 20,000  _  the troop strength of the other twosectors has yet to be determined, the official said.The international stabilization force would be under the U.S. warcommander, Gen. Tommy Franks.At least initially, the coalition stability forces will augmentrather than replace the 135,000 American troops inside Iraq, theofficial said. The stability forces will focus on providing securityand humanitarian relief while other U.S. troops focus on rooting outleftover members of Saddam Hussein's government and other armedelements in Iraq.Rumsfeld said, however, that the more troops other countriescontribute to the stability effort, the fewer U.S. troops will beneeded inside Iraq.Planning for both the U.N. resolution and the international securityforce left out France, Germany and Russia, three U.S. allies thatvehemently opposed the war in Iraq.Some of the NATO members who agreed to send troops may want NATOauthorization for that action, the official said. Requests for suchauthorization will be routed through the alliance's defense planningcommittee, which does not include France, the official said.The outlines for the international stability force were decided at aconference Hoon hosted Wednesday with representatives from 16countries, mostly NATO members. Other countries including thePhilippines, South Korea, Qatar and Australia agreed to send otherhelp such as field hospitals, engineers, explosive ordnance disposalteams or nuclear, biological and chemical weapons experts.The U.S., British and Polish sectors will be drawn to take intoaccount ethnic, religious, tribal and political factions within Iraq,the official said. For example, although ethnic Kurds are themajority in large parts of northern Iraq, there are also largenumbers of Kurds within Baghdad.Some Arab countries also want to play a role in the stabilityoperation in Iraq but are reluctant to send troops because ofpolitical, religious and ethnic considerations, the official said.Countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council have offered to donatemoney for the effort.Rumsfeld also met Friday with King Abdullah of Jordan, an Americanally in the Middle East. Defense officials say Jordan provided keyhelp in the Iraq war, acting as a staging area for U.S. specialoperations raids into western Iraq to prevent missiles from beingfired at Jordan or Israel.Rumsfeld did not say what the two discussed.

===========Input: Court suspends independent paper for publishing letters deemedreligiously inflammatory KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP)A state security court suspended a newspaper critical of thegovernment Saturday after convicting it of publishing religiouslyinflammatory material, the newspaper's lawyer said.The Khartoum Monitor may not appear for two months and must pay afine of 1 million Sudanese pounds (about US$400), lawyer Ngor OlangNgor told The Associated Press. Failure to pay the fine would resultin a two-month extension of the suspension.The sentence was the latest in a series of state actions against theMonitor, the only English language daily in Sudan and a leadingcritic of conditions in the south of the country, where a civil warhas been waged for 20 years.Ngor said the paper would pay the fine but it would also appeal theverdict.The court ruling stated that the verdict and sentence would besubmitted to the National Press Council, a government-appointed body,for approval, Ngor said.The secretary general of the National Press Council, Hashim el-Jazz,did not answer repeated calls to his cell phone on Saturday.The court convicted the paper of violating article 25 of the PressLaw, which prohibits the publication of material that defamesreligion or incites religiously unacceptable activity.The charges arose from letters-to-the-editor published last monththat dealt with religion. One letter claimed that alcohol was notprohibited by Islam.Earlier this week, security police detained the Monitor's managingeditor, Nhial Bol, for 24 hours. On his release, he was charged withincitement of public discord for publishing the letters.Sudan has an Islamic-orientated government and a substantialChristian minority.In a separate action against the Monitor, security officials went toits editorial offices on Thursday night and told the management thatit was being closed until it paid a fine of 15 million Sudanesepounds (about US$6,000) that was outstanding from a court convictionlast year.The Monitor did not appear Friday and its offices were closed.In last year's trial, the paper was convicted of defaming thegovernment for publishing that trains running to and from southernSudan were used to transport abducted women and children.   mk-jbm

===========Input: North Korea may have fired laser at US aircraft, official says, asNorth nullifies accord to keep peninsula nuclear-weapons free SEOUL, South Korea (AP)North Korea's military may have fired a laser at a U.S. helicopter inMarch, a U.S. official said Tuesday, as the communist state ditchedits last legal obligation to keep itself free of nuclear weapons.The aircraft's censors detected the unknown type of laser while itwas flying near the heavily fortified frontier that divides the twoKoreas, the U.S. military official said on condition of anonymity. Noone was injured and no equipment was damaged in the incident.North Korea said Tuesday that a 1992 agreement with South Korea notto deploy nuclear arms on the Korean Peninsula was nullified,accusing the United States of derailing the deal.``The inter-Korean declaration on denuclearization of the KoreanPeninsula was thus reduced to a dead document due to the U.S. vicioushostile policy to stifle the DPRK with nukes,'' said the North'sofficial news agency, KCNA. DPRK stands for the Democratic People'sRepublic of Korea, the North's official name.The announcement came as U.S. President George W. Bush and SouthKorean President Roh Moo-hyun were about to meet Wednesday inWashington to discuss North Korea's nuclear programs.The accord was the last remaining legal obligation under which NorthKorea was banned from developing atomic arms. In January this year,North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, aglobal accord to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.A U.S. military official in Seoul, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said Tuesday North Korea is believed to have exportedUS$580 million worth of missiles to Iran, Pakistan, Libya, Syria,Egypt, Yemen and the United Arab Emirates in 2001.In December, a shipment of North Korean missiles bound for Yemen wasbriefly stopped in the Arabian Sea.North Korea accuses the United States of planning to attack thecommunist country, which Bush has branded part of an ``axis of evil''along with Iran and Iraq. It also revived its claim that the U.S.military keeps many nuclear weapons in South Korea, turning thecountry into ``the biggest nuclear advance base in the Far East.''Washington says it wants to use dialogue to resolve the nuclearcrisis, although U.S. officials have not ruled out a military option.North Korea ``keenly felt that the denuclearization of the KoreanPeninsula would only remain as a daydream unless the U.S. drops itshostile policy toward the DPRK,'' KCNA said.It said the U.S. invasion of Iraq taught it that ``a war can beaverted and the sovereignty of the country and the security of thenation can be protected only when a country has ... a strong militarydeterrent force capable of decisively repelling any attack to be madeby any types of sophisticated weapons.''In New York, South Korean President Roh said he will never condoneNorth Korea's nuclear development, but Seoul and Washington agree thenuclear standoff with the North must be solved peacefully ``by allmeans.''``It is incumbent upon Pyongyang to give up its nuclear project andcome forward as a responsible member of the internationalcommunity,'' he said. ``When the North takes this route, the Republicof Korea and the international community will extend the necessarysupport and cooperation.''Julianne Lee, a Roh spokeswoman, said the North Korean statementmight be a negotiating ploy in the wake of talks last month with U.S.officials in Beijing.During the talks in Beijing, U.S. officials said North Korea claimedit already possesses nuclear weapons, and that it had reprocessed8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods  _  a move that could yield severalatomic bombs within months.North Korea offered to drop its nuclear and missile programs inexchange for security guarantees and economic aid, according to U.S.officials.The nuclear crisis flared in October, when Washington said NorthKorea admitted having a secret nuclear program in violation of a 1994treaty with Washington.

===========Input: Suicide bombing at Israeli shopping mall; fifth attack in two days JERUSALEM (AP)A suicide bomber detonated explosives at the entrance to a crowdedmall in northern Israel on Monday, killing at least four shoppers andwounding 20 in the fifth such attack in two days.The spate of bombings underscored how difficult it will be to carryout the U.S.-backed ``road map'' plan, a three-stage prescription forending violence immediately and setting up a Palestinian state by2005.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday's attack atthe Shaarei Amakim mall in the working class town of Afula, which hasbeen targeted repeatedly by Palestinian militants because of itsproximity to the West Bank.The Islamic militant group Hamas carried out four bombings over theweekend.The Afula explosion  _	the 95th in 32 months of fighting  _  wentoff at 5:14 p.m. (1414 gmt) at the entrance to the mall, reportedlyas shoppers were waiting in line for a security check. Malls andother public places have significantly stepped up security since theoutbreak of Israeli-Palestinian fighting in September 2000.The explosion killed the attacker and four shoppers, police said.Twenty people were wounded, including several who were in seriouscondition.Earlier Monday, a 19-year-old Palestinian riding a bicycle detonateda 30-kilo (66-pound) bomb near a military jeep in the Gaza Strip,injuring three soldiers.In response the spate of bombings, Israel threatened to boycottforeign envoys who meet with Yasser Arafat. Israel holds thePalestinian leader responsible for the latest violence, even thoughthe recent attacks were carried out by Islamic militants.Hamas said Monday it has no intention of halting attacks, despiteEgypt's efforts to have Palestinian militant groups agree to aone-year suspension of shootings and bombings. In a renewed mediationattempt, Egyptian envoys have been holding meetings in Gaza andDamascus in recent days with leaders of the militant groups. Thearmed groups say they might agree to a truce if Israel promises tostop hunting militants	_  a proposal Israeli Prime Minister ArielSharon has turned down.A Hamas leader, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, said Monday that ``legitimateresistance will continue as long as occupation exists on our holyland.''Asked whether Hamas was challenging Abbas, Rantisi said only thatthere was no point in trying to negotiate with Sharon, whom he calleda ``terrorist.''Israel said there will be no letup in its campaign against thoseinvolved in violence. Israel ``will continue to fight terroreverywhere, at any time and in any way possible,'' a Cabinetstatement said Sunday, after a Hamas suicide bomber killed sevenIsraelis on a Jerusalem bus earlier in the day.The ministers also decided to cold-shoulder foreign envoys who meetwith Arafat. ``Whoever wants to visit Arafat can visit Arafat but hewon't be allowed to meet senior Israeli officials,'' said a seniorSharon adviser, Raanan Gissin. Israel first threatened such a boycottseveral weeks ago, but enforced it only selectively.The European Union on Monday dismissed the decision and a spokeswomansaid EU leaders will continue to involve Arafat in the search forpeace.Arafat, who has been confined by Israel to the West Bank town ofRamallah for more than a year, accused Israel of inciting againsthim.``Not to forget I condemned it completely, these terroristactivities,'' Arafat said Monday in halting English, speaking beforethe Afula bombing.``At the same time, you should remember (Israel's) incitement policyagainst me. This is to increase the siege around me. Where did ithappen that a president was forbidden from moving out of hisoffice?''The new Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, has denouncedviolence against Israelis, but also told Sharon in a weekend meeting _  the first Israeli-Palestinian summit in three years	_ that hewants to persuade the militants to stop attacks, rather than disarmthem by force.The argument over how rein in the militants and halt violence hasbeen holding up implementation of the road map. The plan calls forparallel steps in the first stage, including a Palestinian crackdownon militants, an Israeli troop pullback from Palestinian towns and aconstruction freeze in Jewish settlements.Sharon insists the Palestinians make the first move. He was to havediscussed his objections with U.S. President George W. Bush thisweek, but canceled his trip after Sunday's bus bombing. ThePalestinians have accepted the plan as is.The latest wave of attacks began Saturday evening when a Hamas bomberblew himself up in a square in the West Bank city of Hebron, killingan Israeli settler and his pregnant wife. On Sunday morning, anotherHamas assailant blew up the Jerusalem bus and about half an hourlater, a third bomber from the group detonated explosives on theoutskirts of Jerusalem, killing only himself.Israeli analyst Mark Heller said that ``Hamas is trying to ensurethat the road map doesn't go anywhere and that Abu Mazen (Abbas)doesn't go anywhere either.''The three bombers came from Hebron and at one point studied at thePolytechnic Institute in the city. Two bombers, Fuad Qawasmeh, 18,and Bassem Takrouri, 19, lived in the same Hebron neighborhood andwere friends. The Israeli military on Monday demolished the Qawasmehfamily home, part of a policy of trying to deter attacks by punishingassailants' relatives.The three bombers released farewell videos, apparently taken in thesame wooded area. In frame grabs published in the Yediot Ahronotdaily, the three struck identical poses, holding up assault rifles.Each wore a green headband with Quranic verses and an olive-coloredvest with pockets for ammunition and grenades.In another development, Israeli forensics experts identified a bodythat washed up on a Tel Aviv beach last week as that of a Briton,Omar Khan Sharif, 27, the suspected accomplice of a British suicidebomber who blew himself up outside a Tel Aviv pub April 30. Twomusicians and a waitress were killed in the blast.Sharif also carried explosives, but they didn't go off, and he fled.It was not known whether he was hurt at the time. The identificationwas made with the help of DNA samples supplied to Israel's ForensicsInstitute by British detectives, said the head of the institute, Dr.Yehuda Hiss. He said Sharif drowned.   pvs-kl

===========Input: Israeli troops kill Palestinian boy and injure two other children inWest Bank violence JERUSALEM (AP)Israeli troops shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian boy andcritically injured two children, ages 7 and 9, during conflicts inthe West Bank that erupted Tuesday as Israeli and Palestinian leadersmoved toward talks on a new Mideast peace plan.The shootings  _  which the Israeli army said came in response toattacks by Palestinians throwing stones and molotov cocktails  _ camea day after Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon declared thatIsrael's occupation in the West Bank must end, stunning both dovishopponents and hardline allies.Sharon's remarks and Israel's conditional acceptance Sunday of theso-called ``road map'' to peace were expected to jump-start stalledMideast peace negotiations.A summit between Sharon and his Palestinian counterpart, MahmoudAbbas, had been planned for Wednesday but was postponed, according toIsraeli and Palestinian officials, who blamed each other for thedelay. The officials said no new date had been set; Israel Radio saidthe meeting would take place Thursday.A three-way summit with U.S. President George W. Bush could takeplace as early as next week, possibly in Jordan.Israeli soldiers shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian boy andwounded a 7-year-old boy after opening fire at stone throwers in theTulkarem refugee camp in the West Bank on Tuesday, Palestinianhospital officials said. The army said troops fired, and hit a boy,after a Palestinian youth threw a molotov cocktail.In a village near the West Bank city of Nablus on Tuesday, Israelitroops opened fire on youths throwing stones, hitting a 9-year-oldPalestinian boy in the head and critically wounding him, and hittingtwo 12-year-old boys in the legs, lightly wounding them, Palestinianhospital officials said. A 10-year-old boy was struck in the leg by arubber bullet, but was not seriously hurt, the officials said.Military sources said troops were trying to break up stone-throwingprotests, but did not use live fire. The army was not aware of anyinjuries.Five Palestinian children, a Palestinian woman and a police officer,were injured Tuesday after accidentally detonating explosives in theWest Bank city of Hebron, Palestinian security officials said. Thechildren found the explosives in two plastic bags under a tree andaccidentally detonated the first bag. After a police officer arrived,the second bag exploded, seriously injuring him, the officials said.Israeli troops killed a Palestinian teenager Monday and anothersurrendered after infiltrating from Gaza, the military said. Theywere unarmed and apparently looking for work. In a village near theWest Bank town of Qalqiliya, an 11-year-old Palestinian boy waskilled during an exchange of gunfire.Also Monday, Israeli soldiers fired on four diplomatic vehicles inthe northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun, diplomats said. There were noinjuries from the incident. Peter Lundberg, an official from theSwedish Consulate in Jerusalem, said that two bullets hit thewindshield of the Swiss Consulate's armored car, and that small-armsfire also was directed at other cars from Sweden, Denmark and theEuropean Union.Military sources said the Israeli army had established roadblocks atthe entrance to Beit Hanoun to prevent Palestinians militants fromleaving the area. The sources said shots had been fired in the airwhen vehicles tried to skirt the roadblocks.The violence erupted after Sharon endured withering criticism Mondayfrom members of his own Likud Party over his Cabinet's acceptance ofthe U.S.-backed ``road map'' peace plan.Sharon indicated a 180-degree turnaround after decades of warningthat an Israeli withdrawal from even small parts of the West Bankcould endanger Israel's existence.Skeptics, however, wondered whether Sharon's conversion was a shrewdeffort to deflect U.S. pressure in the hopes the road map would failbefore Israel had to make tough concessions.``To keep 3.5 million people under occupation is bad for us andthem,'' Sharon said in remarks broadcast on Israel Radio.The term ``occupation'' is anathema to the Israeli right, whichbelieves Israel has a legitimate claim to the West Bank and GazaStrip for religious and security reasons.Palestinians and their dovish Israeli allies routinely use the word``occupation'' when demanding that Israel leave the West Bank andGaza and dismantle Jewish settlements.Palestinians claim all of the West Bank and Gaza for a state.On Sunday, Sharon's Cabinet conditionally approved the ``road map,''a three-phase plan that begins with a halt to violence and envisagesa Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 2005.Sharon told party critics he was committed to finding a politicalsolution to the conflict, including an Israeli withdrawal from WestBank population centers.``This can't continue endlessly. Do you want to remain forever inRamallah, Jenin, Nablus?'' he asked.Likud lawmakers charged that the road map was slanted in favor of thePalestinians and endangers Israel.In his remarks Monday, Sharon left himself an out.``What will happen if Palestinian terror continues? Nothing. Nothingwill happen. The Palestinians will get nothing,'' he said.Critics have said Sharon's long-held condition that all violence muststop before peace moves is unrealistic and guarantees failure of anypeace initiative, including the road map, thus releasing him from thenecessity of following through on his remarks.Liberal lawmaker Yossi Sarid argued Sharon was trying to keep hisintentions murky to persuade the U.S. government that he wascommitted to the plan, while his hawkish allies could assume he wasjust making a tactical move to end U.S. pressure.``Ariel Sharon likes to walk in the fog, because then no one knowswhere he is headed,'' Sarid wrote in the Yediot Ahronot daily.	   pvs-lja

===========Input: U.S. lawmaker: North Korea says it will produce more nukes SEOUL, South Korea (AP)North Korea has told American lawmakers it already has nuclearweapons and intends to build more, a senior U.S. congressman saidMonday after returning from a trip to the communist state.``They admitted to having nuclear capability and weapons at thismoment,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, who headed a delegation of U.S.lawmakers that visited Pyongyang for three days ending Sunday. ``Theyadmitted to an effort to expand their nuclear production program.''Weldon's comments echoed those of U.S. officials following talks inBeijing in April. They said that North Korea claimed during a pausein the formal talks that it already had nuclear weapons, but wouldgive up the program in return for economic aid and securityguarantees.Weldon said at a news conference in Seoul that North Korean ViceForeign Minister Kim Kye Gwan repeated that claim during a dinnermeeting. Both Kim and Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun told Weldon thatPyongyang planned to produce more nuclear weapons and had nearlyfinished reprocessing the spent nuclear fuel rods needed to do so,despite pressure from the United States and its allies.``They admitted to having just about completed the reprocessing of8,000 rods,'' said Weldon, a Republican who is the No. 2 member of aU.S. House panel that oversees the armed forces.U.S. experts say that reprocessing the rods could give North Koreaseveral more nuclear bombs within months.During their visit to Pyongyang, Weldon's delegation also met ChoeThae Bok, chairman of North Korea's legislature, the Supreme People'sAssembly.Although they were not traveling as envoys of U.S. President GeorgeW. Bush, they were the first American officials to visit since thenuclear standoff began in October. They flew to Seoul on Sunday tobrief South Korean officials on their Northern trip.North Korea said it was developing its nuclear weapons as ``aresponse to what they saw happened in Iraq, with the U.S. removingSaddam Hussein from power,'' Weldon said.A North Korean foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying bystate-run KCNA news agency that the visit helped both sides betterunderstand each other and they shared the view that Washington andPyongyang needed to avoid confrontation and exist peacefully.``They were of the same view that it is necessary to seek anegotiated settlement of the nuclear issue and expressed their standthat it is necessary to continue seeking and discussing ways ofsettling it,'' the spokesman said.North Korea has repeatedly accused Washington of planing to invade.Bush says he prefers a diplomatic solution, but has not ruled out amilitary option.In Seoul, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun said his government hasno ``clear proof'' to conclude North Korea has nuclear weapons.``North Korea has told important people of the United States that ithas developed nukes and reprocessed spent fuel rods. But North Koreahas not confirmed that to anyone else,'' Roh said. ``Thus, we mustmake a very careful judgment on whether we will conclude it hasnuclear weapons or not, based on those words only.''U.S. and South Korean officials say that North Korea may be bluffingabout its nuclear program in an attempt to extract concessions fromthe United States. But U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitzsaid Monday that the threat couldn't be ignored.``Certainly what we know suggests that we should take what they(North Korean officials) are saying very seriously,'' he said at anews conference in Seoul.Weldon said his delegation ``comes away convinced'' that the nuclearstandoff can be resolved in a peaceful manner that allows Pyongyang'scommunist regime to stand while removing its nuclear threats.Roh issued a similar message during a nationally televised newsconference.``South Korea and the United States share a firm principle that NorthKorea should never possess nuclear weapons and that the issue shouldbe resolved through a peaceful manner,'' he said.Roh spoke after meeting the U.S. lawmakers and Wolfowitz, who alsoarrived in Seoul on Sunday for a two-day visit to discuss NorthKorea.Wolfowitz said Saturday in Singapore that Washington hoped puttingpressure on North Korea's battered economy would resolve the nuclearstandoff. On Monday, Wolfowitz stressed that military readiness wasjust as important.In meetings with South Korean officials, Wolfowitz urged them toincrease military spending on new technologies and telecommunicationsequipment, as U.S. forces have done. South Korea earmarks aboutUS$14.5 billion for its military.``They still work with paper and pencil instead of with the kind ofmodern communications gear that our special forces took with them toAfghanistan,'' Wolfowitz said.He said upgrades would allow troops to react quicker to threats fromthe North and help reduce the possibility of a military conflict onthe peninsula, not heighten it.The nuclear crisis flared last October when U.S. officials said NorthKorea admitted running a secret nuclear weapons program in violationof a 1994 accord with Washington.

===========Input: State refused bid to prosecute acquitted apartheid germ warfare head BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP)South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal ruled Tuesday against a staterequest to retry the head of apartheid's germ warfare program, onceaccused of plotting to poison Nelson Mandela.Wouter Basson was acquitted in April 2002 on 46 charges, ranging frommurder and drug trafficking to fraud and theft.Basson was accused of directing South Africa's former apartheidregime's biochemical efforts aimed at destroying its opponents.The ruling by judges Piet Streicher and Mohamed Navsa of the SupremeCourt of Appeal, the highest appeals court in the country, means thatBasson cannot be tried again and his acquittal stands, the SouthAfrican Press Association reported.The state's appeal was based on the judge refusing to recuse himselfduring Basson's 2 1/2-year trial. The prosecution alleged presidingJudge Willie Hartzenberg favored Basson.The appeal judges found Hartzenberg's refusal did not relate to anerror of law on his part.Basson headed a program named Project Coast in the 1980's.During the trial witnesses testified that the project involved tryingto create deadly bacteria and anti-fertility drugs that would onlyaffect blacks. They poisoned opponents' clothing and stockpiledcholera, HIV and anthrax.The alleged intended victims included former President Nelson Mandelaand several African National Congress leaders who are nowhigh-ranking government officials.He had also been accused of siphoning millions of dollars fromProject Coast to finance a lavish, globe-trotting lifestyle and ofselling drugs.

===========Input: Seven convicted in Vietnamese crime boss' trial to appeal theirsentences HANOI, Vietnam (AP)Seven people convicted last week in Vietnam's biggest-ever criminaltrial, including two former senior government officials, haverequested an appeal of the verdicts, a court official said Tuesday.The seven include former state radio director Tran Mai Hanh andformer vice national chief prosecutor Pham Sy Chien, both convictedof receiving bribes, the court official said on condition ofanonymity.The trial by a Ho Chi Minh City court was seen as a litmus test ofthe communist government's resolve to fight widespread corruption.The ``godfather'' of organized crime, Truong Van Cam  _  better knownas Nam Cam  _  was convicted of seven crimes, including murder. Hewas sentenced to face a firing squad, and his lawyer has said he alsoplans to appeal.Hanh, also a former member of the powerful Communist Party CentralCommittee, was convicted of receiving US$8,500 in bribes from NamCam's family to secure the crime boss' early release from labor campin 1990s. Hanh was sentenced to 10 years in jail.Chien was convicted of receiving a stereo set worth 27 million dong(US$1,750) from Nam Cam's family and sentenced to six years in jail.Five other people who were sentenced up to five years in jail forcrimes such as gambling and receiving bribes have also filed appeals,the official said.A total of 155 defendants stood trial during the three months ofproceedings.

===========Input: Mars rover is launched on voyage to look for evidence of water CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP)A rocket holding the first of two Mars rovers blasted off Tuesday ona seven-month voyage to the red planet where the golf-cart-sizedvehicles will search for evidence that there was once enough water tosupport life on Mars.The rover named Spirit lifted off from the Cape Canaveral Air ForceStation aboard a Boeing Delta II rocket at 1:58 p.m. (1758 GMT).Thunderstorms delayed the launch by two days, and launch officialscontended with a last-minute communications glitch between stationsthat will track the spacecraft.The second rover, named Opportunity, will be launched later thismonth, and both are expected to arrive at Mars in January.Moving on six wheels, the $800 million rovers act as roboticgeologists. Each is equipped with a panoramic camera, a camera forclose-up views of rocks and a drill to cut into rocks. The data willbe transmitted back to Earth.Previous missions have shown Mars had water in the past, butscientists want to find out how long the water was there and in whatquantities. Scientists believe the water may show that Mars once wasable to support life.The rovers' landing sites, on opposite sides of the planet, werechosen for their likelihood of holding evidence of water. Studyingthe minerals in rocks can tell scientists how the rocks were formed,whether they were ever submerged in water, and whether hot water everran over them.The rovers are expected to travel up to 132 feet (39.6 meters) eachMartian day, which is 24 hours and 39{ minutes long.The missions are expected to last three months but could run longer.The rovers eventually will shut down as dust builds up on their solarpanels and they will remain on the planet.Only 12 out of 30 previous attempts have reached Mars, and only threeout of nine attempts have succeeded in landing on the planet.NASA revamped its Mars program after the failure of two unmannedmissions to Mars four years ago.The space agency has been under intense scrutiny since February whenthe space shuttle Columbia disintegrated over Texas, killing allseven crew members. A logo patch of that last Columbia mission wasattached to both Mars rovers.	    _	_  _  =On the Net:Rover Mission: http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mer

===========Input: U.S. LIKELY TO WAIT, REGROUP BEFORE ATTACKING BAGHDAD 04-03-03 02:16:00ESTBy EDWARD EPSTEINc.2003 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLEWASHINGTON _ Having punched through severely depleted RepublicanGuard divisions that formed Baghdad's outer defensive ring, U.S. Armyand Marine forces are likely to pause again to test the Iraqicapital's inner defenses and waall but evaporated under the weight ofthe U.S. assault. Their collapse left the U.S. troops less than 20miles from Saddam Hussein's capital. Bet`fow Central Command chiefGen. Tommy Franks and his field commanders face a big decision _whether to rush into the city of 5 million where Hussein's regime hasgathered its most-trusted forces or wait and see if the war can bewon without paying the price of street-to-street urban fighting.``We are expectingn or at least planning for, a very difficult fightahead,'' Gen. Stanley McChrystal said at the Pentagon Tuesday. ``Weare not expecting to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it.''Instead of an all-out assault, analysts expect the United States tofollow the example of British forces outside the southern Iraqi cityof Basra. They are likely to mount small probing patrols into thecity to determine the level of Iraqi resistance.If these patrols meet little opposition, thousands of troops couldrush into the city. If the Iraqis respond forcefully, the Army andMarine units could withdraw and await the 4th Mechanized InfantryDivision, which will soon start moving north from Kuwait. While theywait, the forces would try to determine where Iraqi strong points arewithin the city and where Hussein might be, if he is still alive.``The Basra model will work for a while, at least until you seeproblems with food and water for civilians in the city,'' saidLawrence Korb, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations who wasassistant defense secretary under former President Ronald Reagan.``Before going in (with a full assault), you have to decide if it'sworth the risks, and ... you have to know who's there in the way ofIraqi forces and the amount of potential damage to civilians,'' hesaid.The administration has said it wants to minimize casualties to Iraqicivilians, which makes the British experience around Basrainstructive, the analysts said. The British have been outside thecity of 1.5 million for more than a week. Thousands of refugees havefled the city, apparently providing information to the British thathas led to raids on military and Baath Party sites in the city.``The key endgame may be whether the U.S. can parse out the keyregime centers of power in Baghdad and attack them without having tofight into the city, or at least locate them well enough to atman ofthe Center for Strategic and International Studies said in his dailywar report.U.S. strategists say that Hussein, if he is still alive and incontrol of his forces, might like a bloody battle in Baghdad becausesuch fighting could cause heavy U.S. casualties. His last hope forsurvival might be that the United States loses its taste for suchlosses and forces President Bush to negotiate a compromise that wouldallow Hussein and his family to keep power in Baghdad.But Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution in Washington saidthe apparent collapse of Republican Guard resistance could depriveHussein of much of the wallop he was counting on in the city.``If U.S. forces seriously degrade Iraq's half-dozen Republican Guarddivisions before that final battle, and only have to face perhaps30,000 Special Republican Guard, fedayeen, and related personnel, thetask will not be as hard as it might have been,'' he said.While two guard divisions have apparently been smashed, there arethree others in the Baghdad area. A sixth remains in northern Iraq.Cordesman said it seems the guards have been reinforced by units fromthe regular Iraqi army, which is generally viewed as less reliable.This shows the Iraqi military's growing weakness, he said.``The Republican Guard has taken a massive hammering at every leveland is now scattered and deploying somewhat erratically at thebrigade level,'' he said.The Iraqis still haven't used chemical weapons, even though manyexperts feared such attacks as the U.S. troops neared Baghdad. Korb,who's convinced Hussein has stocks of chemical weapons he neverreported to U.N. inspectors, said he wouldn't be surprised if Husseintried to use them.But he also said, ``He may destroy them to embarrass us,'' to showthe world he never had such weapons and that Bush invaded for noreason other than aggression.The U.S. forces zeroing in on Baghdad _ the 1st Marine Division fromthe east and the Army's 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division _ aretrained in urban warfare. But in such close-quarters fighting, theywould lose much of the technological advantage of their airsupremacy, which would have to be curtailed because bombing in a citycan cause large civilian casualties.However, Baghdad from the air looks like Los Angeles _ wide, straightboulevards intersected by side streets in a grid pattern. ``Ourforces would be capable of dealing with it reasonably. But therewould be lots of casualties on all sides,'' Korb said.

===========Input: CIA SAYS NORTH KOREA HAS NEW NUCLEAR TESTING SITE AND TECHNOLOGY WASHINGTON U.S. intelligence officials now believe North Korea is developing thetechnology to make nuclear warheads small enough to fit atop thecountry's growing arsenal of missideS( potentially putting Tokyo andU.S. troops based in Japan at risk, according to officials who havereceived the intelligence reports.In the assessment, which they have shared with Japan, South Korea andother allies in recent weeks, officials at the Central IntelligenceAgency said that U.S. satellites have identified a sophisticated newnuclear testing site in an area called Youngdoktong. At the site,equipment has been set up to test conventional explosives that, whendetonated, could compress a plutonium core and set onfe nuclearexplosion.[oMa intelligence officials believe that the existence of the testingrange is evidence that the country intends to manufacture much moresophisticated weapons that would be light enough to put onto itsgrowing arsenal of medium- and long-range missiles. Previously,U.S. officials had said they were uncertain whether North Korea hadreceived enough outside technical help to even attempt to make such a``miniaturized'' nuclear warhead. The new testing capability wouldsuggest that the North Koreans are getting closer _ now, officialssaid, the intelligence reports say they could do in in as little as ayear or less. But officials say there is no sure way of knowing thatthey can until they actually test one.Senior administration officials say that Washington has been tryingto convince Asiagent that it requires a unified diplomatic front toforce the country to give up its weapons. The new intelligence isapparently being marshaled to support the administration's argument.According to officials who have been briefed on the U.S. reports,conventional explosions simulating a nuclear detonation have been setoff at the testing site, which is near North Korea's main nuclearcomplex. North Korea has never tested a nuclear weapon, though theCIA long ago estimated that it manufactured two crude devices in thelate 1980s or early 1990s.North Korea, unlike Iraq, has made no secret of its plan to developnuclear weapons. Now, administration officials say they fear that thecountry is on the verge of producing five or six new weapons, some ofwhich might be miniaturized. ``This would give them the range they never had before, and thechance to spread their threat far beyond South Korea,'' said onesenior Asian official, noting that approximately 60,000 U.S. troopsare based in Japan. ``It changes the dynamics of the problem.''The new intelligence estimates provided to Asian allies, however,left it unclear how quickly the North could produce the smallwarheads. The worst-case estimate, officials say, is that they coulddo so in less than a year.(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)U.S. satellites have been watching North Korean nuclear activityintently since late last year, when the North evicted internationalinspectors. Those inspectors had stood guard over a collection of8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods, which can be reprocessed intoweapons-grade plutonium.In January the country began to re-start its nuclear rexrOgessingequipment, which had been mothballed for nearly a decade under a 1994agreement with the Clinton administration. But according to U.S.officials, it now appears that North Korean engineers ran intotechnical problems in restarting the facilities. While intelligenceofficials have reached no consensus, they told allies last week thatin the worst case, only a few hundred of the 8,000 rods had beenconverted into plutonium. It would take 1,000 to 1,500 rods to makeenough plutonium for a weapon, experts say.O``What we are told is that it would take perhaps six months afterthat to produce a miniaturized warhead, and put it into one of themissiles,'' said one senior official who has recently reviewed theintelligence. ``But after Iraq, who knows how good those estimatesare?''After the claims made about prohibited weapons in Iraq, which havenot been found so far, skepticism about the quality of U.S.intelligence is widespread. And in the case of North Korea, as inIraq, the immediacy of the threat depends on whose analysis seemsmost compelling.So far, U.S. intelligence has picked up almost no sign of thetelltale krypton gas that is released into the atmosphere whennuclear fuel rods are converted into weapons-grade plutonium. Thishas led some analysts to argue that the North Koreans may be fartherfrom producing a weapon than feared a few months ago.But others note that trucks were seen carrying the rods out of theirnormal storage area months ago, and it is unclear where they are _ oreven whether the United States is sniffing for the krypton gas in theright place.``We don't believe that the main reprocessing facility has been veryactive,'' said one senior administration official in a recentinterview. ``But could there be a second reprocessor? No one knowsfor sure.''Without question, though, North Korea's capabilities greatly outstripanything Iraq has had in the past decade, and North Korea's programis probably several years ahead of Iran's.President Bush and South Korea's new president, Roh Moo-h is unclearwhether they interpret the meaning of that phrase the same way. Bushhas said he wants a diplomatic solution to the problem, but would notforeclose any option, including military options. Roh has said anypre-emptive strike against the North's nuclear facilities could provedisastrous.

Bush ended here Tuesday with both countriestrying to minimize splits on UN role in rebuilding Iraq after theongoing US-led war against the country is over.As the US-led coalition troops are reportedly thrusting into Baghdadand the second Iraqi city of Basra, Blair and Bush agreed there wouldbe a "vital role" for the United Nations in post-war Iraq.During their first war summit on March 27 at Camp David,  Blair andBush became divided over what a role the United Nations will play inpostwar Iraq, when Bush gave no positive reaction to Blair 'ssuggestion of a strong UN role.After the Camp David talks, Blair, who analysts say has been pursuinga special relationship with Washington in order to restore Britain'straditional role as a transatlantic "bridge", was forced to readjusthis tone.Blair and Bush were expected to bridge their gap on the issue byreaching an agreement on UN role in post-war Iraq, some analysts saideven before this summit at Hillsborough, south of Belfast, the secondof its kind since the war broke out on March 20.In a joint written statement, the two allies pledged to seek UNSecurity Council resolutions to affirm Iraq's territorial integrity,ensure aid delivery and endorse an "appropriate" post- conflictadministration for Iraq."We welcome the appointment by the United Nations Secretary- Generalof a special adviser for Iraq to work with the people of Iraq andcoalition representatives," the statement added.The United Nations would have a "vital role" in the effort to repairIraq's infrastructure, Blair told reporters at a news conferenceafter his talks with Bush, downplaying UN role in emphasizing thatultimately the country must be run by the Iraqi people."The key is that Iraq in the end should be governed by the Iraqipeople," Blair said, pledging that British and US forces would notstay in the country "a day longer than necessary".It was a "false choice" to debate whether Iraq should be run bycoalition forces or the United Nations, said Blair, who was believedto be in favor of a stronger UN role in post-conflict Iraq than Bush.Echoing Blair, Bush said the UN would play a role in all aspects ofpost-war Iraq, from humanitarian aid to a future interim authority,adding that Iraq would "move as quickly as possible" to an interimauthority made up of Iraqis from inside and outside the country.However, when pressed on what precisely the UN role would be, Bush onTuesday mentioned only humanitarian work, "suggesting" people tostaff the interim authority and helping Iraq "progress.""When we say vital role for the United Nations, we mean vital rolefor the United Nations in all aspects of the issue, whether it behumanitarian aid, or whether it be helping to stand up an interimauthority. The Iraqi people will decide who's on the Iraqi interimauthority," said Bush.Bush did not spell out how much power the United Nations would have,nor did he elaborate on Washington's plans to place US officialsalongside Iraqis in the interim administration.Differences still remain between the United States and Britain,analysts said, over the speed with which Iraq should be handed to aninterim Iraqi administration, and the extent to which a US-led groupof generals and former diplomats should effectively run the country.Yet, analysts argued, both Britain and the United States hope theiragreed vision of a postwar scenario will placate anti-war nationssuch as France, Germany and Russia."We will move as quickly as possible to place governmentalresponsibilities under the control of an interim authority composedof Iraqis from both inside and outside the country," Bush vowed atthe joint news conference with Blair, adding that the interimauthority would serve until a permanent government could be chosen bythe Iraqi people."Rebuilding of Iraq will require the support and expertise of theinternational community. We are committed to working withinternational institutions, including the United Nations, which willhave a vital role to play in this task," Bush added.Blair also pleaded the world to avoid "endless diplomatic wrangles"over the future of Iraq like the international dispute over a secondUN resolution on Iraq that preceded the war.France and Germany, which were most vocal in opposing this US- ledwar against Iraq, have been insisting that the United Nations shouldplay a central role in the phase of post-war Iraq.On the unresolved dispute between Europe and the United States,analysts say, Blair might again have to make a difficult choice, buthe is very likely to support the United States, which Britain can notafford to fall out with.

This order came after about two hours' legalproceedings at the Manhattan courthouse in New York, according to aTV report.Before the sentence, there had been speculations among analysts onwhether Waksal would get leniency because his company has beenworking on researches of cancer drugs, a good endeavor in the eyes ofmany people.ImClone's Erbitux drug has been recently accepted to be effective inhelping cancer patients. But the order just released from thecourthouse in New York has obviously separated Waksal's good effortsin making new drugs from his legal problems.Amid the financial storms last year and the ensuing cracking down oncorporate malfeasance, Waksal pleaded guilty in October to chargesinvolving his efforts to sell a huge block of his company' s stock inlate 2001.The attempt to sell the shares were just before ImClone sharesplunged on the news that the Food and Drug Administration rejectedImClone's application to sell the experimental cancer drug, Erbitux.This incident then triggered legal investigations, which alsoincluded the case of a US media and domestic design diva, MarthaStewart.

Bush And His Vision,    - Leadership, Excellent Management Talents, Endurance, Faith And    - Intelligence.    "/>Let's see...There two main qualities to be desired in a Commander-in-Chief,Generalship and Leadership.Because in the United States the Commander-in-Chief is a purelypolitical post, generalship is usually undertaken by the generalsproper under the Commander-in-Chief, provided it is understood that theCommander-in-Chief is ultimately responsible and accountable for theoutcomes of his general's generalship.Generalship involves the technical skills of intelligence gathering,strategic and tactical planning, and the communication of orders.Leadership can be less rigidly defined and is concerned less withcoordination than motivation and how a commander seeks to inspire hismen to fight harder and endure worse privations in order to beat theenemy.President Bush generalship has proven deficient. His planning for thewar was inadequate and his monitoring of the war after the invasionfailed to correct course in the face of the change in circumstancesbrought by a strong and unexpected insurgency.The Commander-in-Chief's generalship can suffice to motivate men ifthey are higly confident that he is a very capable and skilled general.Eisenhower was in that position. That has not been the case withPresident Bush, who unleashed hell acting on faulty intelligence,failed to find any WMD, and left our boys at war wanting for armor.That is not the sort of generalship that on rational grounds alonemotivates men to march to possible death.Men unmotivated by bad generalship can still be motivated byexceptional leadership. In theory, motivation is best carried out by acommander fighting alongside his men. Make no mistake, even when wedon't desire a president with a preference for personal combat, theneed for a commander to be seen to share dangers with his men is asimperative today as it was in times of Alexander of Macedon. That'swhy we look at the military record of our leaders. John Kennedy,George H. Bush, and even John Kerry, the loser, had distinguishedmilitary careers that were apt substitutes for leading men in battle.The knowledge that the Commander-in-Chief once faced grave danger inwar bravely can be the animating spirit of troops facing the samedangers.George W. Bush has no distinguished military career. In fact, CBS andcarrier landings notwithstanding, there is every indication that in thepeak of youth he avoided the dangers of war as much as he could. Thatis not the sort of leadership that on emotional grounds alone motivatesmen to march to possible death.Some might say that George W. Bush is neither a general nor a soldier,he is a politician. He is in charge of Grand Strategy and he delegatesthe rest.True. But as Commander-in-Chief he is the Ultimate General and theFirst Soldier.George W. Bush, the Politician, is not very good at grand strategyeither. The aim of grand strategy is a prosperous and secure peace,and by his several blunders over the psychology of his opponents, thepolitical and economic effects of his actions, and the failure toerradicate terrorism and even capture he most wanted terrorist, GeorgeW. Bush, he has failed to realize the aim of grand strategy.I'll be glad if Iraq becomes a truly democratic country. But will it?And at what price? Are you willing to pay with a deficit of billions,thousands of Americans dead or badly wounded, and the unmeasurabledisruption that a foreign war causes to the life of our nation at alllevels, for each country in the world that is in the grip of a tyrant?I am not. Let those countries grow a generation with the guts and thewillingness to originate democratic change and I'll support joiningother nations to back the ef. But unilaterally, or worse leading acoalition featuring tyrannies, effect such change remains a bad idea,Iraq's elections notwithstanding.George W. Bush didn't do well in the industrial private sector wheresuccess is measured by return on investment. Government suits such aman perfectly; there is no balance sheet to worry about. There isevery indication that the new rulers of Iraq will do business as usualunder a democratic varnish. The interim government didn't hesitate totorture opponents, just like Saddam did. the Shiites will be nodifferent. That will be our return on investment.Iraq wields democracy like Britney Spears wields the electric guitar,it looks cool and trendy but she has no idea of how to play it.

Inthese eight locations, hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, bombs,and rockets are stacked in both open and bunker storage, some of themleaking their contents and all of the very deadly. Storage locationsinclude:-- Anniston Army Depot, Anniston, AL-- Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Pueblo, CO-- Bluegrass Army Depot, Lexington, KY-- Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD-- Toelle Army Depot, Toelle, UT (the granddaddy of them all)Destruction is underway in Anniston where the Dept of Defense built andis operating an incinerator to burn weapons located there. Plans wereunderway to build destruction facilities at all other locations but nowthe Bush junta has removed from its proposed defense budget for fiscalyear 2006 all but the minimum funding for these destruction projects.Plans to destroy chemical weapons are now stopped, except for a smalltest program at Toelle. Contractors (Bechtel was the main contractor)have been told to stop all design and construction work and there-assign their people -- the destruction programs are dead.)Can anyone spell "W. M. D."?Can anyone tell me which nation in the world owns the most WMD? (Hint:It's neither Iraq, Iran, nor North Korea -- none of the famous "Axisof Evil.")You don't suppose they have stopped destroying these weapons becausethey plan to use them?

I really think it's time for the church to admit that acivil ceremony followed by a temple sealing reaches the same goal, often ina more loving way, than insisting that only the sealing is worth doing. Achange of that sort would be very simple to implement, and most churchmembers would like it better than allowing non-LDS family members into thetemple, which would actually be my preference.There's been a thread recently in one of the exMo fora about a woman whosebishop, who she had been planning to have marry her, was going out of town,so she asked the stake president, who she didn't know well. He insisted thathe needed to make the point, as part of performing the ceremony, that shereally needed to be married in the temple, even though her fiance was notLDS. She ultimately declined his services.How to get the message across to young people that considering the feelingsof their family is just as important as being sealed for time and alleternity? I don't know. It would have to be some sort of grassrootsmovement, I think, since it's not likely to come through official,correlated channels.Peggy--A dog can never tell you what she knows from thesmells of the world, but you know, watching her, that you knowalmost nothing.-- Mary Oliver RBradfo...@kc.rr.com : *shrugs* I chose to have a civil ceremony largely because my wife and Iwere both converts and a temple ceremony would have excluded both familiescompletely. From a family standpoint it sounded liek a good decision,harmony and all that...plus the temple ceremony could be sealed a yearlater. Unfortunately we started off on the wrong foot for a lot of reasonsand the marriage didn't last. I can't help but wonder if perhaps we didourselves a diservice by not getting sealedi ntially, and making ourmarriage a gospel focused one. Who's to say. It's a tough decision to makeand despite the feeling I myself caved I feel people should be understandingof the rationale.

But there was atime when I did like her; in fact I loved her very much in spite of hernumerous flaws, chief among those flaws is that she's a narcicists.But we all have some sort of personality problems ....My wife belongs to a support group, and just for fun, they all googledtheir hubbies ex's.Somehow, this lead me to googling my ex's boyfriend, call him B. Andthere he was, talking about plans with his wife and kids. Wow. To me,B was just this one dimensional guy that was being dragged along by myexwife. Now, he turns out to have a 3 dimensional life too. I guesswe all do. I'd like to take him out for a beer sometime. It would befun.I wonder what happenned to B's son? My kids never mentioned B having ason. B's son is apparently 16 years old, same age as my daughter. Iwonder if B had a huge messy divorce, and his ex took the kid out ofstate. My ex threatened that. Ouch. Divorce really sucks. I have mykids almost 50/50 these days, but it was a huge messy post divorcecompromise that took a year to complete. I wonder if B had to gothrough some of the same kind of shit? Perhaps my exwife has moresympathy for what its like to be a guy on the receiving end of adivorce now?Ok, keep googling. Oh my, the plot thickens. I found B's exwife.Very articulate writer. This is really humorous. She wrote an articleabout a divorce support group, ending it with something about Mrs. Bbeing happily married but she's impressed by the divorce support group.And that was only 4 years ago! Mr. and Mrs. B had a real life too.They shared dreams together, raised a kid, and probably had a lot offun together. Now I'm even more curious about the B's kid. She stilllives in town here. Maybe there was some sort of terrible tragedy???I'll have to ask about B's kid when my own kids switch off next week.Sometimes we want to see marriage one dimensionally. Either its bad orgood. That's total bullshit. I know my first marriage had a lot ofgood adventures, a lot of friendship, a lot of love. Oh, yeah, itwasn't perfect. My exwife is a total pain in the ass much of the time,and I tried to let her do what she wanted, sometimes I couldn't. But,even to the end, we loved each other. And now, I see the lost familyties. She's lost my family, I'm slowly drifting out of touch with herfamily. We both build new lives.New lives. But you know, as long as the kids are shared, you can'ttotal get this exspouse out of your mental psyche. They say it takesone year for every two that you were married. I believe that.Meanwhile, life goes on. My wife's name is M. We're going to a bedand breakfast this weekend, to get away, relax. M and I are slowlybuilding a history of our own together. We share adventures together,we share adventure with my kids, and with our dogs. And, I take lotsof pictures. I really haven't changed very much from who I was before.Although, the dog thing is really post divorce. Lots and lots ofpictures. Sometimes I look at the old photos, before divorce. Wesmiled together, laughed, hugged. I was one of the first digitalcamera users, and I have too many photos from my first marriage.Sometimes I feel like I'm racing to create enough photos of my new lifeto outweigh the long history of my first life. That's going to takeawhile... Luckily, we flawed human beings live long lives, and digitalcameras take lots and lots of pictures!If my exwife doesn't dump B, maybe they'll wind up staying together,maybe even getting married. I think that would be nice. And they toowill begin the process of rebuilding their "together" lives. I'massuming there is some humanity beneath my exwife's narcicistic shell,but I do believe there is. B seems like a decent enough person too.So, B and my ex will be doing the same thing that I'm doing.Rebuilding their lives.Anyway, all of this gets me back to my original point. Divorce seemsreally really stupid. It seems to me, that beneath it all, we all wantthe same things. Love, companionship, and a partner for our life'sjournies.None of this makes total sense to me. But I just thought I'd ramble.- Hiking Barbara Sz. : Your post made me horribly sad.My ex has that nice new life with the child-bride and the 2 cats and 2dogs and new house and my son primarily lives with them even though heends up being at my place 1/2 the time in a 2-week period. -- I live ina 961 sq. ft. apartment.My ex has most all of the photos as our son lives there and it's hishistory. I did get a good bunch of the wedding photos, but my exrefused to give them all to me saying it was "his life too" even thoughI really resent them being under the same roof with his child-bride.I'm sure they are taking lots of pictures of theirtrips/vacations/whatever (at least 2 that I know of). I don't own acamera.His new inlaws are all former family friends I don't have anything todo with anymore for obvious reasons. His family (brother, sister,stepmother) conveniently seem to forget that for almost 20 years I wasa member of their family. There was no gradual "drifting of out touch"despite the fact that we all live in the same city and my ex BIL and Ieven work within blocks of each other. My family thinks my ex is pondscum but because my parents are still members at the same church, theyhave to see my ex and his new wife every week. My mother took hisremarriage harder than I did, I think, because of that.Divorce *is* really stupid. Duh-uh. Especially for those of us whostill have so many years (if one year for every 2 married, then I'vestill got another 7 or so) to go to get our heads screwed back on andfind some sort of life that rivals what we had or what our ex has orwhat you and your ex have. So far, this is not it. -- Barbara Sz.

Gateway advertised andstickered many of its 486 computers as "Pentium Ready", meaning that aspecial Type 3 ZIF socket Pentium OverDrive could be installed and run.Micronics designed the motherboards used by Gateway, and the basis ofthe design was a prototype Pentium OverDrive with an internalwrite-through cache, a more conservative cache design. Then Intelchanged the Pentium OverDrive, and the final version had a write-BACKcache. When installed in a Gateway system, the chip ran slower thanslow, maybe about as fast as an IBM AT, and bus-mastering devices likeNICs and SCSI cards refused to work.So the lawyers sued Gateway, and the settlement approved by the judgeconsisted of megabucks for the lawyers and coupons to owners of Gateway486 computers.  The coupon was good for $50 off on the purchase of aPentium OverDrive processor from Gateway, at its usual inflated prices!!! So, let's see. What does a discount coupon for a processor I can'tuse in my system do for me? I wonder how many people gleefully cashed intheir coupons and bought Pentium OverDrives from Gateway.Intel eventually compensated by making available an "interposer", alittle socketed thingie installed between the Pentium OverDrive and theZIF socket.  The sole purpose of the interposer was to raise a signal onthe CPU to force its cache to operate in the write-thru mode which wascompatible with most ZIF Socket 3 486 motherboards.Needless to say, this was the least successful "OverDrive" CPU ever doneby Intel. The 486-DX4 OverDrive was OK, as were several Socket 5 PentiumOverDrives and the Socket 8 Pentium Pro OverDrive. Finally Intel gave upon OverDrives...

"/>Actually more of the money from your donation has a chance of goingdirectly toward its intended purpose than any other charity. The RedCross normally deducts 9% from all deductions for its administraticecosts. It has announced that it will forego the 9% on donationsearmarked for tsunami relief and that 100% of these funds will godirectly toward aid.9% in administrative costs would place the Red Cross among charityorganizations making the the most efficient use of donated funds. Thefigure for most charities is 10-16%.I don't know what negative stories about the Red Cross you have heard.But nothing is 100% and no organization of any kind is perfect. Justbecause of its size, which dwarfs most other charities, I would assumethat the Red Cross may be responsible for proportionately moreblunders than most other charitable organizations.------------------------------ ------------As tragic as the earthquake and tsunami in South Asia have been, it istruly uplifting to see how so many people have opened their hearts andso generously responded to the call for help toward disaster reliefefforts.

===========Input: organizations committee Lauren Rouse : Howdy,Lauren Rouse here. I'm in charge of getting everyone excited aboutcontacting organizations so Marcella can meet with them. Next week wewant to have as many dates as possible set up for her as we can, so weare asking y'all to please talk to your organizations to see if theywould be interested in having Marcella come and speak. In the nearfuture we will be expanding this to include all the otherorganizations that we can contact, but we are just keeping things safefor now. If you are interested in helping out with contactingorganizations then please let me know, cause I need all the help I canget. There are 6 sub committees under the organizations committee:Greek (2)Department of Multicultural services (Tasha should have this takencare of)MSC (2, but I think Crystal is taking care of some of this but shestill will need some help)Student Activities (3)Academics and colleges (2)International (1)I am going to need that number of people to help with contactingpeople in these areas, so please let me know asap.So, as I said earlier please just stick to contacting yourorganizations this weekend and friends you may have in otherorganizations. I have attached the welcome packet info if they areinterested and I have the cheat sheet to use as a guideline for whenyou talk to them (just in case you don't have them yet). Remember tostress that Marcella can either meet with the execs or the whole group(whatever works best), that she will be talking briefly, and that shewill be there because she wants to learn about that group's concernsand issues at A&amp;M. Don't say anything like "vote for Marcella" or"support Marcella" cause we don't want anyone to get in trouble.If they are interested in setting up a meeting then have them contactme at 979-777-6445 or at laurouse...@yahoo.com and I will send theinfo to Tori, or have them contact Tori Foster to set up a time.Also, let me know who you have already contacted and set up a meetingwith so that I can make sure we don't call them twice.Ok guys, sorry for the long e-mail and the rambling, but I want tomake sure that I have everything covered.

===========Input: Question regarding simple assault & battery Annie Juhlyn Simon : My roommate was hospitalized in mid-November for lung surgery and spent severaldays on loads of pain medication. On the fourth day of his stay, he was movedout of the ICU to the step-down unit, with a diagnosis of "ICU Psychosissecondary to narcotic administration" and post thoracostomy." He was confused,because of the medication but was not aggressive or threatening in any manner.I saw him each day and as soon as we spoke, he became oriented and wasperfectly fine. This was witnessed by both the nursing staff and his doctors.During the early evening hours of his sixth hospital day, he got up, dressed,pulled his chest tube out and managed to get out of the hospital and acrossfour lanes of busy evening traffic, to our apartment. By the time he got toour home, he was very short of breath and there was a nurse and orderly whotold me "he's crazy and just walked out." I sat him down on the couch andtalked to him, and asked him what had happened. He said he'd asked forsomething for pain and they told hime he couldn't have anything. Then theorderly was apparently rude to him, and that's when he got up and decided tocome home. A short time later, two police officers showed up and told me theyhad to take him back to the hospital. He went back with the officers, gavethem no problems at all. I received a call from the shift supervisor who toldme they'd replaced his chest tube, given him some pain medication and he wasdoing much better. I told her to pass on the other shifts that if he becameconfused or upset to call me, and I'd talk to him, and get him settled down.At 2:15 the next morning, I received a call from the night shift supervisor whotold me my friend had been "verbally abusive and aggressive" and would I comeover and talk to him. So, I went over there, getting to his room right at2:30. There were two cops there and I asked what had happened. My roommatewas in bed, sound asleep, and had all of his clothes on. A nurse said, "Hebeat two of us up.The cops are here because we're pressing charges." I've lived with this man 9years and never in that time have I ever seen him be aggressive, violent orabusive in anyway. I asked to speak to the two nurses whom he'd alledgedly hitand was told I couldn't do that.An hour or so passed and the got my roommate out of bed, took his chest tubeout and discharged him. He was sent to another hospital with a psych unituntil his psychosis resolved. I was given copies of a citation for simpleassault and battery, then went to the police station several days later to findout what other paperwork was available on this incident. I was given a copy ofa different citation, but with the identical information from the one I'dgotten the night of the incident.The police report has the victim saying she was "choked to where she almostlost consciousness, struck in the face with a belt buckle and it had left largemarks, and that he'd grabbed her breasts and left marks. According to thepolice report, this woman never reported to the ER for verification of theinjuries and no one else can verify exactly what happened to provoke thisincident. My roommate has no recollection of the time from the day before theincident happened until he woke up at the other hospital.He was cited for simple assault and battery. If there is no evidence, and thatincludes the belt buckle, how can the county prosecute this case.? All of hisbelongings were returned to me upon his discharge, with the exception of thebelt buckle. The police do not have it and the hospital doesn't know whathappened to it. Also, I was looking at both citations, I didn't get to thehospital until 2:30 am, and the officer has the time of incident as being at2:34 am. Does anyone besides me see a problem with any of this?

Thattechnology has undoubtably made it back to North Korea (Pakistan, Iranand North Korea are all working on the same set of missile blue prints).So now we have North Korea with nuclear weapons and workable missiles.Also since we missed the boat on North Korea and Nuclear weapons how canwe be sure that Iran doesn't have nuclear weapons? The simple andwisest action is to assume that they do have a small number and areworking feverishly to build a bigger arsenal.Now the nut of the question should be, What if Iran gives, sells,provides nuclear weapons to Islamic extremists to smuggle into theUnited States and at 10 AM on a Wednesday pop 2 or 3 in New York City,destroying Wall street, the large banks, the large Insurance companies,the large sock brokerage houses and many other world wide financialinstitutions.At the same time 2 weapons go off in Washington DC and take out thePresident, the Vice President, 80 Senators, and 350 congressmen as wellas the department of the treasury, Interior, Health and Welfare,Justice, Commerce and the Federal Court system. And then just for yuckslets assume that one goes off at the Pentagon.Now what do we do?Remember all your pension funds are now gone.all your investments are gone.all the bank records are gone.No more government payments for federal employees.No more government payments for aid to schools, environment,police, courts, Well fare, etc.The Dollar is now worthless on the international market.With a worthless dollar the amount of fuel available is notcut by 80%.No more cheap imports of clothes, boots, appliances, computerstuff, communications equipment, generators, electric motorsCars, Trucks etc.Massive unemployment as we are now in a service economy withnothing to service.Does the word TEOTWAWKI have any meaning.Oh I expect to things to hang together for a few weeks as local, county,and state governments try to hold things together, but they won't.With out fuel to move food stuffs from the farms to food manufactures tolocal warehouses food stuffs will dry up with in a few week or so.With out fuel to move imported stuff (most of what we buy these days)from the ports of entry to local warehouses and local retailer shelvesof items like building materials, tools, and every thing else we buy theshelves will be empty in a month or so.Of course the above does not take into account that people driven byfear don't riot and loot every thing in site in the first week.If the attack should happen in the winter, no Natural gas from Canada toheat homes, or fire steam driven electrical generators. Of course wecould convert back to coal but it will take a couple of weeks to convertthem to coal but then how do you get the coal from the mines to thepower plants???With no Social Security or pension payments, Aid to Dependent Childrenand other government payments, food stamps, (which are all checks andvouchers), and there are no banks to cash them, (they got all wiped outin the New York financial destruction remember) no body will accept them.No the situation doesn't look good from where I sit.Oh we can work on the assumption that the Mullahs of Iran will berational, (but how rational are people who train and fund suicidebombers) and a rational Kim Junk Ill (who lets large numbers of hispeople starve to death every year so he can have nuclear weapons)kidnaps Japanese Citizens to teach English, Kidnaps movie stars so hecan have private performances etc. Look at Kim Jung Ill behavior overthe last decade or so any you will find that Hitler was a saint comparedto Kim Junk Ill.No it's going to be a scary time for the next decade or so and theneo-chamberlins (most of the leftist that most on this board) (you knowprime minister chamberlin holding up his piece of paper containing anagreement from Herr Hitler with peace in our time), are not going to doone thing to keep this country safe.By the way I consider, Kerry, Dean, Kennedy, Carl Levin, Lathey, Murry,Finestien, Boxer, (Oh hell the whole Democratic party) and members ofthe press as neo-chamberlins.Well on to a happier note.I have a job interview today for a permanent position that will pay 20%more than my contracting does and will have benefits.Contracting here in Oregon is going at $14.00 an hour at Intell, up to$20 an hour at other places. Why should Hi tech firms pay more in theUnited States than they do in China or India?Just heard yesterday that Hewlett Packard is shutting down its plant inEugene, (Thank you very much MS.

"/>Probably not. But if he was required to list the shares in bankruptcyfilings, and didn't, the answer may be different. I think, though, that anytransaction after the bankruptcy filing date is part of his new life.--Tom Healy, CPABoulder, COWeb: Shyster1040 : Was the trustee informed of the transfer of the shares? Since you gaveyour uncle the shares prior to his discharge, the shares should havebecome assets available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction ofdebts. If the share transfer was reported to the trustee and the trusteedid nothing about them, then you may be ok; however, if you failed toinform the trustee, then your uncle may be liable for hiding assets, whichwould, at the minimum, invalidate his discharge. Even if the transferdoesn't invalidate the whole discharge, the distribution might be subjectto forfeiture to pay creditors' claims if you failed to inform the trusteeof the share transfer.You need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney pronto; this is a bankruptcymatter, not a tax matter. superprimen...@gmail.com : the bankrupcy filing took place in 2003, but it didnt clear until early2004 and that was when i gave him the shares. He had no shares in 2003. Shyster1040 : Yes, but according to the facts you first gave, he had not yet received thebankruptcy discharge when you gave him the shares. I believe you had saidthat you gave him the shares in February 2004 but that the dischargedidn't come until June of 2004. That means that he received the shareswhile he was still in bankruptcy, which means that the shares werepotentially assets that the trustee could use to pay off creditors.A bankruptcy case doesn't close until you get the discharge order, anduntil then everything that the debtor receives is fair game for thetrustee. If the trustee was informed of the shares and did nothing aboutit, you are more likely than not ok, but if the trustee wasn't informed ofthe fact directly, then you may be in trouble.If, however, your uncle received the shares after he obtained an order ofdischarge from the bankruptcy court, then as a general matter thecreditors cannot go after the shares, unless they can prove that there wascollusion between you and your uncle to hide his assets from them (e.g.,by putting his assets in the corporation's name and then waiting untilafter the bankruptcy to transfer the shares to him).

I've wondered too, with all the forensic advances in the past 25years why he hasn't been identified. Here's a link.Sue D. raylopez99 : You do well to wonder why the BTK killer was not captured untilyesterday.The informal speculation is that the Wichita police department was notup to the task.Consider this:-One of the BTK killer's victims lived on the same street as the killer-The BTK killer once called up a police dispatcher and told her of thecrime he just committed, and still they could not catch him-the BTK killer was a known nitpicker and nuissance. This is actuallya indicator in profiles of serial killers and mastermind terrorists.-the BTK killer was only found out when his daughter recognized certaintraits and turned in her DNA, which was a close match to the DNA onfile for her father. Like in the case of the Unibomber, if it wasn'tfor the foresight and charity of a relative, the BTK killer would stillbe loose.I was once reading how a criminal was being tracked in Washington, DC,and how he escaped a police dragnet several times, once by taking ataxi.

Immediately after shetook office, she found out that the USCF had no money in the bank,zero. The USCF did not even have the money to pay the guaranteedprizes at the just concluded US Open in Los Angeles.Therefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz walked into the USCFOffices in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members. JohnMcCrary resigned from the board as a result.Of course, it was just a pure coincidence that the 17 people Beatrizfired were the people she had grown to dislike during the year thatshe worked for the USCF in 1999-2000.It took six weeks before the USCF paid the guaranteed prizes the prizewinners had won at the US Open.I have just found out something that insiders had known for a longtime. The USCF did not have zero money in the bank. It had $85,000 inanother bank account that nobody knew about. This was not due to anymalfeasance. The office accountant for the USCF had set up a separatebank account and had put the entry fees from the US Open into thataccount. Nobody knew about that separate bank account, except for theaccountant herself.When this was discovered, the accountant explained that she wasplanning to keep the money in that account until the tournament wasclosed out. Perhaps the accountant was following a procedure followedby the USCF for scholastic tournaments. At scholastic tournaments, nocash prizes are paid. However, in adult tournaments, the playersexpect to receive their prizes, and to receive them immediately.For this act of stupidity which had caused a grave crisis in the USCF,the accountant was immediately fired.Had the existence of this $85,000 in a secret bank account been known,it would not have been necessary to fire those 17 people right away.Perhaps in the long run it was a good thing to fire them, but it mightnot have been a good idea to fire them all abruptly, in the same day.Sam Sloan StanB :     <QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="    Sam Sloan (s...@ishipress.com) wrote in message    news:41c1ad89.59230906@ca.news.verio.net ...    - Turns out the August 2003 crisis was not a crisis    - Everyone has heard the story: Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF    - President on August 11, 2003 in Los Angeles.

And I knew about it also.I also knew about the $100,000+ of audit adjustments (and non-adjustments) forinventory, unbilled advertising, newsstand sales, tournament revenues, pension&amp;health insurance over-accruals, multi year membership revenue, etc. etc. thatI was too sick to argue with Linda and the auditors about. I knew that theywould get corrected as a matter of course during fiscal 2004 resulting inunderstatement of 2003 income and overstatement of 2004. And, of course, thatis what happened. I just had no idea that the new Board would see it asleverage to seize power and pummel the office staff.Not only was there adequate cash put aside, we had approval for an equity loanon the building to bridge the move. But I didn't want to pay the $10,000 pointsand interest unless and until it was absolutely necessary. We also had a buyerfor the building at a prize much higher than it was eventually sold for and acommitment for 4% bank financing in Crossville.Staff reductions were clearly in the works pending system changes that would befacilitated by any move, Miami, PBG, Crossville or elsewhere. To make the staffcuts without the system changes was absurd and probably the reason for McCrary&amp;Camaratta's departures.When I offered to attend the Board meeting in October 2003 to explain andclarify all this, I was told I was not welcome. I sat in New Windsor allweekend waiting for a phone call so I could answer EB questions and shed lighton the situation. It is no coincidence that the employees let go includedsubstantially all those who had offered to transfer to Crossville, including(remarkably) the employee of the year!You can read all this in my book coming out next summer.Thanks for seeing the truth for a change.Best wishes to all,Frank NiroIn a message dated 12/16/2004 10:55:45 AM Eastern Standard Time,    <QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="    samsl...@samsloan.com writes:    Turns out the August 2003 crisis was not a crisis    Everyone has heard the story: Beatriz Marinello was elected USCF President    on August 11, 2003 in Los Angeles.

=================================================
===========Input: Ethical and legal issues in hiring Marinello Petrel : It has been suggested that there is, or was at one time, some sort ofdelegates' motion which established a minimum period between the timesomeone could leave the EB and the time someone could be hired by the USCF.I don't know if this is so, and I really think it's sort of irrelevant.It's irrelevant because the REAL question is whether an active board membercan, while on the board, arrange to be given money by the USCF. Of courseit's in the bylaws that an active board member cannot be given money by theUSCF while on the board. It ought to be pretty obvious that it would beentirely contrary to the spirit of this for an active board member to bemoney after leaving the board. Suppose, for example, there were to be aproposal to the effect that each EB member would be given $10,000 upon theexpiration of his/her term. Clearly this would be a transparent attempt toevade the bylaws and would fail. If the board cannot vote to givethemselves present money, they cannot vote to give themselves future moneyeither.Furthermore, it doesn't matter whether this arrangement is embodied in an EBvote or not, or whether the discussion of the proposal takes place in aformal EB meeting or not. A board member, while on the board, is supposedto be representing the interests of the USCF, not feathering his/her nest,in the present or in the future. If a board member makes such arrangements,it is clearly an ethics violation, clearly a violation of the bylaws,possibly endangers our tax-exempt status, and is possibly a violation of lawas well.The purpose of having a "time limit" would be as a mechanism to ensurecompliance with the above principles; that is, you would have a time limitbecause it would reduce the likelihood that someone would be tempted toviolate the above prohibition; it would give the voters time to elect a newEB that would consider the issues objectively.Of course, it is possible that someone could leave the board -without- everhaving discussed being compensated by the board in the future, and that thenthe remaining members could, for good reason, hire that person. It wouldcreate questions among the suspicious - and avoiding this appearance ofwrongdoing would be another good reason for a time limit - but it wouldn'tautomatically be an ethics or bylaws violation.But this is neither here nor there, because the fact that Randy Bauer isalready talking about Beatriz Marinello as the USCF's new "movecoordinator", whatever that involves, and whether or not it means that shewould be the de facto interim ED, means that at some level and in some formthese discussions HAVE already taken place, while Marinello is serving asPresident. I mean, it's conceivable that the other six have all gottentogether in Marinello's absence and drafted her, but it also seems prettyclear that she has agreed to do it, and, if all the rumors are true and shesteps down, it will be so that she can take on these new responsibilities.So the 'time limit' issue doesn't even come up. We pretty much know thatMarinello, while on the board, has arranged to get future money from theUSCF. So we already have a problem. If this is NOT a problem, I wishsomeone would explain to me why not.Now, Stan B. argues that Marinello's services are in fact indispensible asmove coordinator, and that ethics standards are not a suicide pact, so thatsince we absolutely NEED her the EB has the right to go ahead and retainher. I agree with the principle. But I think that to make this argumentwork the EB would have to produce some evidence that Marinello really ISindispensible for this task. This would have to include evidence that theEB had considered all the alternatives, including:- delegating the whole thing to the Interim ED, which would be the normalpractice in normal organizations with an ED- asking the Interim ED to designate someone from the New Windsor staff toact as move coordinator- asking the Interim ED to hire some other consultant with experience inoffice relocation to manage the job (there are such people)- conducting some kind of actual search for candidates for the positionduring the last two months since the move was decided uponIf they did consider alternatives, it would also have to include evidencethat Marinello has much more experience at relocating offices than otherpeople, or is willing to do the job cheaper (although this wouldn'tconstitute being "indispensible" in my view).If, however, they just looked around the room and said "who is going tomanage this?" and someone said, "Beatriz, how about you?", this does notconstitute proof that her services are indispensible, and thus it wouldn'tinterfere with my belief that there has been an ethics violation and abylaws violation.One very bad argument that was made by Kevin Bachler, which to be fair wassurrounded by arguably better ones, was that since this board was elected,we should let them do as they please. Which is to say that there might aswell not be bylaws, ethics standards, laws, etc., since an elected board isnot bound by any of them. I think this idea should be rejected.Another argument, which is better but still disturbing, is that, yes, thisis an ethics violation, and maybe worse, but it would only hurt the USCF totalk about it, and that only troublemakers like Sam Sloan, Larry Parr, and,I suppose, me, would talk about it, since doing so will obstruct thefederation's plans, cause us to pay legal expenses, run the risk of ourbeing stuck without any office space at all, cause people not to loan usmoney, and so forth. So we should all ignore this because it is realisticto do so. I'm not entirely unsympathetic to this, actually. But frankly Ithink that a whole lot of the problems the USCF has had over the years havehad to do with well-intentioned people keeping secrets because bringing themout in the open would harm the USCF, and as a result we have awful habitswhich hurt the USCF even worse.But if we are going to talk about realism, here is another realisticconcern: I predict that, if, in fact, the rumors about the agenda for theFlorida meeting prove true, and Marinello resigns as President and is hiredas move coordinator, the immediate result of this is that Sam Sloan willfile another lawsuit (or amend his current complaint) charging the USCF EBmembers with self-dealing, violation of the USCF's own bylaws, and everyother thing, report us to the IRS, and demand that all USCF moneys whichmight be used to paid Marinello be frozen. This is not based on anycommunication from Sam, direct or indirect. It is just logical. If he iswilling to file a lawsuit on the basis of New York non-profit organizationlaw, which might or might not be applicable to the USCF, why wouldn't hefile a lawsuit on the basis of the USCF's violation of its own bylaws, whichunquestionably ARE applicable to the USCF? I wrote a few days ago quotingmy own employer association's attorney, who said that courts mostly letassociations do what they want UNLESS they violate their own bylaws. It isirritating enough to get sued by Sam Sloan; imagine how irritating it wouldbe to get sued by Sam Sloan and BEATEN by Sam Sloan because you have donesomething so egregious that a court is forced to agree with him.petrel

===========Input: OT: new stuff on US election fraud Chris Rockcliffe : <SUBJECT> US election fraud: whisper growing to a roar Now a person stating he is Republican insider is blowing thewhistle, indicating that the fraud was much greater than justa handful of votes in Ohio and Florida. The Ukraine hasnothing on it. According to this person Kerry won decisivelynot only in Ohio and Florida but also in a number of otherStates and in the overall popular vote. He says he knows howthe fraud was worked.Could this be why so many in the Bush gang have been jumpingship? How will it affect the two snivellers John Howard andTony Blair if the whistleblowing becomes as insistent as itdid over the far, far lesser offences of Richard Nixon or thepersonal indiscretions of Bill Clinton?The article is at. Thanks toTony Troughton-Smith for posting this article on the StopMAIWA newsgroup. See for astatement by Michel Chussudovsky about the host site.Dion GilesWestern AustraliaVoter Fraud in Florida and Ohio:Kerry Won the Election by at least 1,7 Million Votesby Brad MenfilThe URL of this article is:----------Brad Menfil is not my real name. I work for the RNC[Republican National Committee]. I fear reprisals if I'mfound out.The truth about this election is this: Florida and Ohio had togo for Bush in order for him to "win" the election. In realityhe lost both states. In fact, he did not even win the popularvote. He lost the national popular vote by at least 1,750,000.This shows you the scale of the fraud.The exit polls were not wrong. Kerry was the clear winner, butvictory was snatched from him.Florida first. The 200,000+ margin of victory for Bush madethis state uncontestable. Everybody assumes that even withsome fraud, Kerry could never have made up the difference in arecount. But Kerry actually won by about 750,000 votes. Thenumbers were changed by a computer program (in both electronicand scan-tron voting systems) called "KerryLite.""KerryLite"of course is not actual name of the program. The actual nameis 11-5-18-18 etc. For additional encryption, the numbers werejumbled but I'm not sure in which order. The numbers replacethe letters of the alphabet. For example, K is the eleventhletter of the alphabet.So the if-then statement goes something like this: "if totaltrue Kerry)total true Bush, Bush x 1.04x (.04 is a randomnumber)(total true Kerry), total true Bush". The second partof the equation takes the total number of votes cast andsubtracts the new Bush total, subtracts the third party totalsand leaves the rest for Kerry.Sometimes the program would also reduce third party votes andaward them to Bush. And even where Bush legitimately won, hewas still awarded additional votes. The big Democraticcounties (Broward for example) went to Kerry because it had toappear that everything was on the up and up. It's interestingto see this unfold. Does anybody wonder why the Republicancounties were mostly counted after the Democratic counties?You should wonder, and also know that this was no accident.The Bush team had to make up the votes as the night went on.In Ohio, computer voting fraud, vote tossing and votersuppression were the main methods. Vote tossing was simply theremoval of Kerry votes and some third party votes. In someareas, the Bush vs. Kerry votes were absurd. Nine to one,eight to two.Voter suppression took the form of making voters stand in fourhour long lines. This of course took place in Democraticareas. The simplest thing to do was to have too few votingmachines. Sometimes that's all it takes. People eventuallylose patience and leave without casting a vote.In other states such as New Mexico, Nevada, Iowa and NewHampshire, Kerry's leads evaporated very quickly once thepolls were shut down. Kerry only won New Hampshire, butbarely. As it turned out, the lead was 6% for Kerry in thatstate and not enough fraudulent activity took place to flipthe state to Bush.So this will all come out and be known to everyone. Nothingthis massive can be kept a secret. You're already beginning tosee these "irregularities" and the whisper will become a roar.

===========Input: There is one Carousel organization again Rapid T. Rabbit : I just received the latest issue of Merry-Go-Roundup, the quarterlypublication of the National Carousel Association. In it was a blurb reporting that the AmericanCarousel Society had recently disbanded.Some of you may be wondering why there were two carousel organizationsin the first place. The National Carousel Association was founded inthe early 1970's by a group of art historians and collectors, includingFrederick Fried, author of the 1964 book "A Pictorial History of TheCarousel" that single-handedly gave the classic hand-carved woodencarousel the respect and appreciation it deserved. Other foundersincluded Charlotte Dinger, who was already a major collector ofcarousel artwork at the time. The purpose of the NCA is "to promoteconservation, appreciation, knowledge and enjoyment of the art of theclassic wooden carousel and especially the preservation of completewooden carousels."The organization attracted a wide range of members, including carouselenthusiasts, owners/operators, theme and amusement parks, museums,libraries, those in the entertainment/recreation industry, artcollectors and even auction houses, among others. It was the presenceof these last two named groups that would eventually stir upcontroversy.Thanks in large part to the NCA, the art of the carousel was receivinga lot of public attention and appreciation that it had not enjoyedbefore. However, this new and brighter spotlight on these antique ridesalso had the unfortunate effect of enhancing the collectibility andmonetary value of operational carousels. They had become worth moremoney dead (i.e. in pieces) than alive (i.e. functioning). As such,during the 1980's many beautiful and unique wooden carousels would bebroken up at the auction block, as owners rushed to cash in on theantique marketplace. The liability insurance crisis further aggravatedthe situation, as amusement park operators sought to cut their losses,while at the same time liquidate underperforming carousels to raisecapital for the purchase of newer and more profitable (thrill) rides.Some collectors of carousel art and auction houses were accused ofusing their NCA affiliation to gain information about vintage carouselsthat they could target for breakup to their own personal profit, apractice certainly contrary to the stated goals of the organization.The increasing rift between the "preservationists" and "collectors"would eventually boil over into an internal political struggle thatcaused many in the collectors faction of the NCA to walk out of thegroup, including founders such as Charlotte Dinger and others. Thepreservationists would chose to remain with the NCA, including FredFried.At this time in the late 1970's, carousel artwork collector and printerMarge Swenson was the editor of the NCA's Merry-Go-Roundup publication.The political struggle that occurred within the NCA resulted in twoslates of officers being presented for approval to the membership,something that was not supposed to happen. A thicker-than-usual issueof the Roundup would be filled with accusations from both factions inthe group each accusing the other of improper behavior. Swenson herselfwould also leave the NCA. Not much later, she began publishing her ownmagazine called "Carousel Art", which was essentially a scholarly photoalbum depicting different carvers and styles each month. Meanwhile,those collectors who left the National Carousel Association bandedtogether to form the American Carousel Society (ACS), whose stated aimsof carousel preservation also recognized collectors as a positive assettowards that goal.For the next couple of decades, the two carousel organizations wouldco-exist, each attracting its share of members. Some would actuallyjoin both groups, and even attend both of their annual conventions.During the mid-1980's Walter Louck would begin publishing "The CarouselTrader", later renamed "The Carousel News &amp; Trader". This monthlymagazine would cover all angles and sides of the story of the carouseland be well received by all carousel enthusiasts. About a decade later,Carousel Art would suddenly cease publication. The NCA would continueto issue the Roundup to its members.The mid to late 1990's saw the passing of NCA founder Fred Fried, andalso that of Charlotte Dinger, both who represented the two oppositepoints of view in the carousel preservation debate.Coincidentally and amazingly, the art of building hand-carved carousels(and even bandorgans) has been revived, with firms such as CarouselWorks and Carousel Magic again building the popular rides in classicdesign. This development seems to have greatly alleviated the antiquemarketplace pressures that have doomed so many legacy wooden carouselsover the past several decades.The turn of the new millenium actually witnessesed a thaw in therelationship between the National Carousel Association and AmericanCarousel Society, as newer and younger leadership took over from thefounding generation. The two groups decided that the bickering betweenthem was wasteful, conterproductive and pointless. There was talk of a(re)merger but the regulations governing non-profits prevented that.However, it was decided that NCA and ACS hold joint conventions to saveon costs to both the clubs and the members.Just within the past couple of months though, the American CarouselSociety had determined that they did not have the funding to continuewith the operation of their organization and officially ceased toexist.So now, once again there is a single nationwide organization to join ifyou love carousels!Rapid T. Rabbit

===========Input: Club Sports policies at schools; specifically travel restrictions d-c...@northwestern.edu : Hello everyone -I am attempting to learn more information about the policies of variousathletic departments at schools, specifically with regards to ultimateteams. At Northwestern, the Men's Ultimate team falls under the ClubSports department which falls into a dark, barely lit corner of theAthletic Department. There are some restrictions on what we can andcannot do. The one that I am most interested in comparing to similarpolicies at other schools concerns our ability to travel.At Northwestern, we are allowed to either rent school vans for nocharge or take our own vehicles to tournaments within 300 miles ofEvanston, IL. Also, we are allowed to fly, take a bus, or take Amtrakto any tournament we want, no matter how far away it is. We areallowed to compete under the Northwestern name if we take any of theseoptions.However, it often occurs that we want to go to a tournament fartherthan 300 miles without flying. (For example, Regionals is oftenslightly farther than 300 miles, yet a reasonable drive.) If we chooseto do so, it is understood that we are not officially competing underthe Northwestern name - we are just a group of people playing ultimateat a tournament and not involving the university in any way.Do any of you other college players face similar restrictions in yourtravel? What are your schools' policies? I am interested in both theresponses of players at public and private schools. Feel free to emailme if you do want to post to the forum.Thanks for your help.CesaNorthwesternd-c...@northwestern.edu SeanMcC...@gmail.com : Man...you guys have it so sweet.

Next year we will be budgeting ourjerseys as "practice jerseys" however, so we hope they'll be paid for.The point is, $2k gets us to about a tournament and a half usingUniversity transportation.I dont know about playing officially under the university's name, orwhy that matters really. As long as the registrar signs off on theroster for the UPA, doesnt the importance of University affiliationbecome moot? d-c...@northwestern.edu : I should clarify that NU does not specifically pay for us to fly - weget a budget as well. We pay for our flights/rental cars out ofpocket.I am specifically interested in the "driving radius", as we call it.What is your school's? It matters for liability questions.Cesa cots...@yahoo.com : At SUNY Albany in NY, about as state school as you can get, we getabout 500 less than what you're talking about at Pitt. Our schooldoesn't really care what we do at tournaments or how far away we are.We take our own cars to every tournament, even ones down in Maryland.The money we get from our student association has to pay for jerseys,is supposed to help us with tournaments, etc. Every tournament ourteam goes to, we each pay 10-20 bucks out of pocket.If you are an ultimate frisbee team and sleeping in hotels... consideryourself as spoiled as an ultimate team gets in my opinion. You gottalearn how to save money. Most tournaments will house you if you askand explain your situation. If we can't get housing, we camp outsomewhere. At Binghamton this year we threw up a tent on the high jumpmat (which I must say is very comfortable). Regionals 2 years ago, ourteam and about 7 others couldn't afford housing at Princeton so wecamped way way out back on the fields and hung out all night.For you northwestern guys, you really need to get in touch with someoneat your school that will listen. Our school didn't like us for a longtime, but we behaved ourselves, and very respectfully approachedvarious people, working our way up the ladder, about changing somepolicies. Start off low, and work your way up. Explain to them thatif you are driving your own cars, you should be able to go wherever youwant, and even throw in there if for any reason you bring shame to theuniversity, you will go right back to the old policy no questionsasked. How often do you go to a tournament and whatever happens theregets back to administration? pretty much never so your safe with thatoffer.Another thing we did was have a lot of fundraisers on campus, enteredbanner contests for sporting events, etc. Once the school saw thatunlike a lot of clubs, we were busting our asses to fundraise and getinvolved with school activities, their whole attitude towards uschanged. Sell discs, sell pint glasses, then go to someone, more thanone person, and show them what kind of effort you are putting in. Alot of school officials don't understand how structured ultimateactually is. Go in and explain to them about Regionals not just beingsome little "get together" but actually be a championship series.Hope my rambling gave you some ideas that might work~SquirrelPS CLIPBOARD NOW, SEAN FOR THE FUTURE!!!!!!!!!!!    <QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="    d-c...@northwestern.edu wrote:    - I should clarify that NU does not specifically pay for us to fly - we    - get a budget as well.

Howie : My wife and I were guests at a wedding on the Carnival Legend on NewYears Eve 2003. All the guests were folks who had met the bride andgroom (an attractive young couple who were sailing alone) virtually oncruisecritic. The wedding took place in the afternoon, before the shipset sail. Thus, the couple was actual married by a justice of the peacein the state of Florida. It was a great way to begin a cruise.Although I am not certain of this, I assume that renewing your vowscould actually be done while the ship was at sea, because it would notinvolve any legal issues.Howie    <QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="    eric...@verizon.net wrote:    - Has anybody out there seen this done?    - I saw somewhere on their site there is a lot of prep time needed to get    - married onboard.    - I wonder if its easier just renewing your vows as my wife has been    - looking for this for a while.    - going out on the Sensation in March for our 18th anniverary.

===========Input: Post-trip report - London ohaya : Hi All,We *just* got back into Washington last evening, after our brief 5-daytrip to London. Thanks for all of the responses to my earlierinquiries, I'm happy to report that everything went pretty well, butboth my wife and I are pretty beat/tired.We got into Heathrow on Monday morning. At the airport, I got some cashfrom the Barclays ATM just outside the arrival area, as many havesuggested. FYI, I just checked my bank account, and we got charged a$2.00 fee and the exchange rate was around $1.92/GPB.After that, we took the underground into London. Zone 1-6 all-day passcost 5.40 GBP each. That was pretty easy... the most difficult part wasfinding the hotel once we finally got off at the final tube station.The hotel was nice enough to let us check in, even though we were a bitearly (we got in around 12:30, normal check-in time was 14:30), which wewere really grateful for, after dragging our bags for a couple ofhours. After settling into the hotel room (my wife is an "unpackeverything-and-stow it" type of person), we went to do a littleexploring. Being that this was a holiday, a lot of the local placeswere closed (including restaurants in the hotel), but we found a kind ofcombo newsagent/foodstore nearby, and we picked up a 5 GBP calling card(for calling home) and some drinks (1.59 GPB for ~2 liter Pepsi light,.98 GBP for a ~2 liter water).It took us awhile, but we found a restaurant/pub (White Swan) that wasopen. It seemed like a kind of local place, and the woman that wasrunning the place was very nice. When we walked in, we stood aroundwaiting to be seated :), and she said "this is a pub, sit anywhere, andorder at the bar". I gathered (from that and a few visits at otherpubs) that that's the norm. Anyway, we had a nice late lunch: fish andchips (with "mashed peas") for me, and a beef pie for my wife. FYI,this was probably the most reasonable meal that we had during our wholevisit.That night, we walked around the area around the Victoria undergroundstation, because we were suppose to meet up with a tour the nextmorning. While there, we found a local Sainsbury (kind of a smallsupermarket) about 2 blocks from the underground station, and stocked upon some cheese, milk, and croissants. Prices here were a bit cheaperthan the local foodstore, and during our trip, I made several trips here:).We weren't sure what we wanted to eat for dinner, so we just wanderedaround a bit, and finally ended up at a "steakhouse" near thestation...big mistake. The food, service, and prices were very bad... Iguess we should have figured that one out when 3 other parties walkedout AFTER being seated, but unfortunately, we had already ordered, so wefelt kind of obligated to finish. I don't know if this is the case withall "steakhouses", but we stayed away from them all after that :(.We took an all day bus tour (Evan Evans), including the London Eye.Took the underground to Victoria, and walked to the Victoria CoachStation (it's NOT the same :)). I thought that the tour was a prettygood way to get introduced to part of the city. We got to see a lot ina short time, including extended tours of Westminster (felt kind ofstrange walking over dead people) and the Tower of London (neat!). Thistour included lunch at another pub near Trafalgar Square (more beef piesfor us), and the tour guide was very good, and kind of funny. It waskind of like travelling with a "grand dad" and he did his best to keepus all together. At the end of the land tour, we went on ride on one ofthe Thames cruise boats (warning, it is FREEZING on the top deck...),and then a ride on the London Eye. All in all, recommended, butafterwards, both my wife and I agreed that an "all-day" tour was tooexhausting (even on a bus tour, you have to do a LOT of walkingespecially getting to the Changing of the Guards and at the LondonTower), and we probably would've preferred breaking it into 2 1/2 daytours.We also took one of the hop-on/hop-off bus tours (the "Original") on oneof the other day, as we thought it was the easiest way to get around tothe places that we wanted to re-visit. A couple of comments: take theone with the live guide if you can, as it's much more interesting thanthe ones with the recorded commentary (you can ask questions). Also, ifyou want to get a seat on the top deck, take one of the earlier buses,as at least when we were there, it was impossible to get a seat on toplater in the day, and you can't see much from the lower (enclosed) deck(but it's much warmer :)!).We had been buying the 2-zone all-day tube passes (4.20 GBP each)everyday, just to get around to dinner and shopping on our own, but bythe time this was all over, my wife didn't feel like taking theunderground back to Heathrow, so we had asked the hotel conceierge tomake a reservation on an airport bus (15 GBP each), but he insteadoffered that he could get us a private car direct to the airport for 35GBP, which is what we did. This was perfect, because it got usdoor-to-door from the hotel to LHR Terminal 3 with no hassles at all. Iwouldn't have done that from LHR to the hotel, but since the conciergewas arranging it, I felt that it'd be safe, and the driver turned out tobe pretty nice.Overall, it was an enjoyable, but really exhausting trip (we live in thesuburbs, so I guess we're not use to walking everywhere).Luckily this wasn't a "shopping" trip, because things are (at least fromAmericans) really expensive. I think that if I was dealing in GPBs allthe time, it wouldn't seem so bad, but I remember sitting at the icecream ("gelato"?) counter at Harrods, and watching two little kids, eacheating some sundaes that cost 15 GPB each ($30.00), and thinking"wow!".Jim Deep Frayed Morgues :     <QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="    On Sat, 01 Jan 2005 18:00:00 -0500, ohaya (o...@cox.net) wrote:    -It took us awhile, but we found a restaurant/pub (White Swan) that was    -open.

===========Input: Comments on suggested travel plans through New England Ringo Langly : Hi all,I live in Austin, Tx, and being one who's only been as far asNashville, Tn two friends and I are planning a trip to New England fora week. I'd love some insight or suggestions on our trip itinerary --First i went to Expedia and did some flight checks. We're planning ongoing July 4th week -- what better time to be in Boston I figure :)Saturday, July 2nd- Fly from Austin, Tx to Boston and stay with friends living in BostonSunday, July 3rd- Hang around Boston and stay with friendsMonday, July 4th- Hang around Boston and stay with friendsTuesday, July 5th- Leave early and drive to Niagara Falls, NY - 467 miles- Stay in Niagara FallsWednesday, July 6th- Leave from Niagara Falls and drive to Toronto, On - 85 miles- Drive back to Niagara Falls that evening - 85 miles- Stay in Niagara FallsThursday, July 7th- Leave Niagara Falls and drive to Red Bank, NY - 435 miles- Stay in Red Bank for the night- We want to hit-up Jay and Silent Bob's Silent StashFriday, July 8th- Drive back to Boston passing through New York -- do whatever-- 262 Miles from Red Banks to Boston but add whatever miles from NewYork- Stay the night with friends in BostonSaturday, July 9th- Fly back to AustinI figure staying in Red Bank, NJ, which isn't far from NYC, is cheaperthen staying in the city. Plus while driving back north to Boston wecan spend the day in NYC. I know there's WAY too much to do, but Ihave another friend who works at the MET I'll try to hook-up with.We'll plan our few hours in NYC wisely.Also we're hanging in Boston for so many nights to visit with thefriends there and hit the sights in that area. Also this is avacation, so we hope to spend some time just chilling.Any suggestions on changes? We have 3 people going, and Expedia showsthe flight (round trip) and a rental car with unlimited miles being$1430, plus I'm figuring about $150 for gas and at $120 a night forhotel that's $360 total for that.So total cost (without food, spending cash, parking, toll roads, etc)is $1910 or about $637 each. I'm figuring about $850 per person shouldbe plenty for everything -- and that's not bad for 7 nights in NewEnland with all the stuff we're planning.Did I miss anything or does anyone see any suggestions or changes thatmight either save money or make our trip more worthwild?Thanks again, and take care,RingoOh -- what kinda weather can we expect up there during July? Texas isin the 100's normally, so I hope the averages for July in New Englandare a fare bit cooler :) B Vaughan :     <QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="    On Fri, 28 Jan 2005 10:02:44 +0200, henry...@eircom.net (Henry) wrote:    -Ringo Langly (rlan...@gmail.com) wrote:    - Wednesday, July 6th    - - Leave from Niagara Falls and drive to Toronto, On - 85 miles    - - Drive back to Niagara Falls that evening - 85 miles    - - Stay in Niagara Falls    "/>[snip]    <QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="    -If you're going to be at Niagara Falls, I can understand why you'd want    -to see TO 'because it's so close'.

This is exactly what I'm looking for:)The main reason I'd like to goto Toronto and Niagara Falls is mainlybecause it's so close.. but I agree New York would be nice to spend afew days in.I know the bulk of our trip is in Boston, but we have friends living upthere we hope to spend a few days with visiting. The trip is both tovisit with them and to spend time around New England.As for gas, what is the going rate for gas right now in New England?Here in Texas it's around $1.60-$1.75 for Reg Unleadded, but i'mfiguring $1.90 a gallon. Is this not accurate? Here's how I figuredthe price I'm factoring in --Boston to Niagara Falls - 467 MilesNiagara Falls to Toronto - 85 Miles and 85 Miles backNiagara Falls to Red Bank, NJ - 435 MilesRed Bank, NJ to Boston (plus spending some time in NYC) - 262Total is 1334, but I'm figuring 1500 with some extra for around NYC andvarious towns we visit. We're getting a mid-sized vehicle, so if thecar gets 20 mpg that's 75 gallons used. This times $1.90 is $145.50 oraround that. Even if gas is $2.00 a gallon that's still only around$150, so I think $200+ for gas is a rather high estimate.Also is it possible to take a train from Boston to NYC? If so how doesthat work or what's the cost? I am from Texas where we driveeverywhere, and I've never even set foot on a train -- so forgive me ifthis is a weird question :)Thanks again for all the insight and help. Though I've never been upthere I've always wanted to see both Niagara Falls and Toronto, sobeing so close I almost hate to miss an opportunity.Take care,Ringo

Americahas positioned its pieces on the chess board of global domination verycarefully. Here are the options:1. The US will use Hmong American sentiments against LPDR as thestarting point for a regime change in Laos. However, Laos is not thegoal; checkmate is the fall of China, and economic control of China.The US will support one or two Hmong individuals to speak out againstLPDR human rights violation and Chao Fa resistance fighters. With aprecedant set in Iraq for preemptive attacks, Laos will be takenovernight and become a source of invaluable logistics for U.S. militaryattacks on China.2. The US's policy of handing out NTR will have the desired effect ofreeling in alliances from the surrounding countries of China. Laosalready has NTR. We shall wait and see if Chinese fat or American fattaste better to LPDR. If LPDR plays ball with Uncle Sam, then therewill be no bloodshed in Laos. When the Americans get into Laos, theartificial cooperation will be sufficient for some strategic politicalchanges. Some Hmong Americans may be reintroduced to Laos. Some Hmongin Laos, namely, Chao Fa, will be a good source of intelligence onLao-China border activities. This will be Chao Fa's chance to replacetheir diet of tree roots with rice and fish. Again, America has LPDRunder its control, and America can launch airstrikes and ground unitsfrom Laos.3. Regardless of what happens, the U.S. has a direct ethnic connectionto China by way of Hmong, which will secure CIA-insurgency operations.Unlike the current situation in the Middle-East, where the number ofArabic-speaking CIA agents are few, there will be plenty ofHmong/Chinese-speaking CIA agents for disposal and use in the loomingSino-US war. Perhaps by route of Thailand, if LPDR does not cooperate,the US will incite insurrection in the southern provinces of China.These provinces have a lot of Hmong people, and have been known to bethe fiercest opposition to Chinese rule (aka Remember the MiaoRebellions?). This will be the Hmong's God-given chance to fight fortheir own country. Let's see if they (and we) agree to a coaltiongovernment like the Kurds in Iraq.Those are just 3 options. They all involve Hmong people. Read betweenthe lines, the war will not be between the US and North Korea. China isusing North Korea to escalate Sino-US relations and test Uncle Sam'stemper.I sure hope I am not sitting and watching when this all goes down. Thisis the perfect opportunity.As Hmong people say, "Water runs strongly, engine sounds good." Born2beHmong : Zhen, i thought that you are an expert of fixing things...LOL! now, youare expert of preemptive strike...LOL! Nuked is a key element to have avote in this current day. it will make more stable and balance of theworld that we live in because no one can deter the others. and, nocountry will have absolute power and authority .......cuz the deter ofNuked....to wide out world wide....................WW3 with Nuked,could dry and free some new dry sand land for Hmong men as Zhen'swishful dream...hahhahah!Born2beHmong

The Enroncontract, which legally binds the Government of the State ofMaharashtra to pay Enron a sum of 30 billion dollars, was the largestcontract ever signed in India. Enron was not shy to boast about themillions of dollars it had spent to "educate" Indian politicians andbureaucrats. The Enron contract in Maharashtra, which was India'sfirst 'fast-track' private power project, has come to be known as themost massive fraud in the country's history. ( Enron was another of theRepublican Party's major campaign contributors). The electricity thatEnron produced was so exorbitant that the government decided it wascheaper not to buy electricity and pay Enron the mandatory fixedcharges specified in the contract. This means that the government ofone of the poorest countries in the world was paying Enron 220 millionUS dollars a year not to produce electricity!Now that Enron has ceased to exist, Bechtel and GE are suing theIndian Government for 5.6 billion US dollars.

"/>For a slightly different perspective:"Maharashtra officials say the cost of power supplied by Enron is nearlydouble the tariff charged by Indian power producers, and used it as anexcuse to stop paying state debts to the plant. ""Enron had signed a power purchase agreement with power utility MSEB eightyears ago, under which a $3bn 2,182 Megawatt power plant was to becommissioned. But the project ran into trouble nearly two years ago with theIndian authorities beginning to delay payments saying Enron's power tariffwas too high...Though Enron officials refuse to talk about the price theywould be willing to sell their stake at, analysts say the US company isdemanding about one billion dollars for its investments in India. So far ithas only got offers of about half that amount from Indian companies andfinancial institutions, but Enron is unwilling to sell its stake at a pricelower than the cost. In case no satisfactory offer comes from the Indianside, Enron will have little option but to go for international arbitrationas their investments in the country were guaranteed by the IndianGovernment. But arbitration proceedings can be a long and messy affair.Analysts say both India and Enron have little to gain from a protractedlegal battle. The best way out could be a compromise by which Enron getsless than what it is demanding and more than what the Indians are presentlyoffering.IOW: No fraud, just a basic business dispute, in which the party reneging onits obligations is the gov't of Maharashtra.The Maharashtra officials are either incompetent fools, or worse- maliciousfraudsters who conned an international comapny into building astate-of-the-art power plant for them at a cost of billions of dollars, andthen refused payment, knowing the company has no legal recourse exceptlengthy international arbitration, and will likely sell the plant to themfor a fraction of its true value.

I actually can't recall it ever taking 2weeks to "count" these many ballots, generally elections are calledwithin 24 hours. In this case counting is taking 2 weeks.What is strange is everyone knows who won, Sistani won. His party, themajor winner, could not field canidates until just before the election,but it was his face on all the poster and his part wipped up theheavily funded US supported government.So we have the voice of the people of Iraq, even if the Sunni's hadvoted Sistani would still be the majority leader. But he was notrunning. So the US has entered in to the classic Shia quicksand ofIslamic Republics, which have caused it such problems in Iran.Sistani will run Iraq, or the election will be ignored. The problemwith Sistani running Iraq is he refuses to talk to the Ameircans, andas the real power broker what ever figure heads take the PM and otherposts will speak with as little authority as their counter parts inIran. The US is now fighting a war for a nation who government theyhave no direct ties with.The other option, and what the US seems to be trying, is to somehowfudge the election so Sistani does not win, that raise doubts about theoutcome, claiming fraud, do anything so that the election causes toresults. Given the American attention span is about 10 minuts thecreation of a dictatorship of US puppets against the election would beignored in the US. This would actually be not only in the US bestinterest, but might be militarily necessary. I can't imagine how theUS Occupation could operate in a situation where Sistani has theultimate power.In the long run I can't see how Iraq can avoid civil war, since its hadit so many times in the past. Civil War leading to the victory of onegroup is the norm in Iraq, and was the casue of most mass graves in the1980s and 1990s. Likely only sanctions have killed more.Sistani has the popular support and the claim of the election which theAmeircans bungled baddly and allowed him to take over. The Sunni'shave the weapons, the skill, and the support. The US occupation isbecoming more difficult by the day and Bush has shown he fails tounderstand the situation. Hell when the worst possible event in theelection was happening, Sistani was flooding the polls with hissupporters Bush was crowing. Sadly Bush's concerns are short-termpolitics in the South of Ameirca, and they have already decided theydon't have to pay attention to Iraq.With more and mmore Sunni supporting the insurgents Iran, the bigwinner in all of this, will feel the need to back Sistani in the south.So if the US leaves its possible we could see Iraq carved up betweenthe groups.As for a civil war, its already started. old hoodoo : It is pretty bizarre, considering how long they had to organizeelections. It may be that they want the public to get adjusted to thefact that the Shia's are taking over before announcing official results.The US is not going to change the results. A shia government willallow us an exit strategy. All we have won in iraq is maybe a shakyneutrality. Its not like Germany or Japan where they were so terrifiedof the Soviets post war that they were happy to see the US stick around.I myself would have been happier with a Mushariff militarydictatorship or junta taking over. That is the only way to keep religionout of running the government. In my opinion, all we have to the averageIraqi citizen is brought a new type of domination.Many small businesses will have to close down (alcohol related)women will have to dress head to toe again, etc.There is only one ray of hope, that Sistani will prove a verystrong leader and actually care about the moderate muslims in hiscountry andprotect them. Its a wait and see gameAs for the Sunnis, they are probably going to have to be crushed.    <QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="    rhooker...@hotmail.com wrote:    - This is getting strange.

"/>Here's something I wrote as part of a larger article, some while ago:Wasn't Japan just defending herself when she attacked the US?This line of reasoning seems to derive from arguments that Japan was being"driven into a corner" by sanctions, and had no choice but to attackthe US. Meiji Japan was driven to emulate what it thought the West wasdoing in every facet of society. They had observed, for example, that theWest was able to carve up China into "Spheres of Influence", and was ableto do from great distances, while they, the Japanese, had had limitedsuccess in their previous attempts to dominate the Korean peninsula,much less China. As part of the catch-up effort, she whole-heartedlyentered into the Imperialist game in Asia, being treated as an equal(relative to her power) by the other powers. However, after World WarI, Japan failed to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitudes of herformer Imperial partners; they began a long, slow process of disengagingthemselves from their former Imperial areas, from their colonies, inaddition to outright stopping all expansions. Japan chose to read thisas a sign that the West had lost its power and resolve, and that Japanwas the rightful heir to Imperial mantle in Asia. With the deaths ofmany of the idealistic leaders who had led Japan's rise to internationalprominence, and the refusal of the US to intervene in Asian affairs,in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the stripping of possessionsfrom Germany, Britain found herself alone in dealing with an increasinglyaggressive Japan in the area. Having a keen grasp of the obvious, shebegan a policy of acceding to Japanese hegemony in the area.Japan continued a policy of acquiring territory for some grand, illusivescheme of a "Greater Asia", subordinate and grateful to Japan. Thereality of this was that only a single possession, Manchuria, wasprofitable to the Japanese, and the rest of the Empire turned out tobe a drain. This drain was greatly accelerated by Japan's invasion ofChina proper in 1936. It was a war that Japan assumed would be endedin "3 to 6 months"; at the time of Pearl Harbor, it had been going onfor 5 years, at the cost of over half a million Japanese lives. Thewar put a tremendous strain on Japan (and was in fact opposed by moreradically NATIONALISTIC elements, as taking away from the developmentof Japan's other possessions, particularly in the areas of scrap metaland fuel.) Domestic consumption fell, consumer goods became scarce,and the use of materiale for war purposes ate into Japan's domesticindustry. This cut further into her foreign reserves, exacerbating theeconomic impact of the war. The war effort took on a life of its own,however, and common sense was subordinated to it. Japan expanded intoareas of China and Indochina which had no strategic value to her, but puther in a position to threaten British and Dutch possessions in the area;possessions that both those Allied nations needed in order to continuetheir fight against Hitler. At this point, the US stopped ignoring theJapanese threat, and imposed a series of escalating sanctions on Japan,cutting off her scrap metal, limitting and then cutting off her oil(Japan imported most of both from the US.) While Japanese officialsrealized that they had enough of each resource for Japan to do well IFTHE WAR IN CHINA STOPPED, they were powerless over the military theywere supposed to control. An abortive attack on Soviet positions inMongolia had placed Japan's focus firmly south, towards the possessionsof the US' future allies. For no reason anyone could articulate, Japanfelt she had to continue the war in China. To continue the war in China,she had to have resources of oil and metal. To have these resources,she must seize them, if others refused to sell them. In order to seizethem, she felt she had to attack and destroy the naval power of the US.Thus, for a "3 to 6 month" operation in China in 1937, Japan would embarkon a war that would strip her of all the possessions and industriesshe had acquired in 70 years. she must seize them, if others refusedto sell them. In order to seize them, she felt she had to attack anddestroy the naval power of the US.Thus, for a "3 to 6 month" operation in China in 1937, Japan would embarkon a war that would strip her of all the possessions and industries shehad acquired in 70 years.Mike--

Many careless observersfelt at the time that the success of Lincoln was due entirely to thefact of there having been three opposing candidates in the field; or,in other words, to the dissensions in the Democratic party, whichdivided its vote between Breckinridge and Douglas. What merely moralstrength the Democratic party would have gained had it remainedunited, it is impossible to estimate. Such a supposition can only bebased on the absence of the extreme Southern doctrines concerningslavery. Given the presence of those doctrines in the canvass, nohypothesis can furnish a result different from that which occurred. Inthe contest upon the questions as they existed, the victory of Lincolnwas certain. If all the votes given to all the opposing candidates hadbeen concentrated and cast for a 'fusion ticket,' as was wholly orpartly done in five States, the result would have been changed nowhereexcept in New Jersey, California, and Oregon; Lincoln would still havereceived but 11 fewer, or 169 electoral votes--majority of 35 in theentire electoral college." Abraham Lincoln, A History, Volume 2by John George Nicolay and John HaySee for aconfirmation of the electoral arithmetic: the states where Lincoln got anabolute majority of the popular vote (i.e., all the free states except Oregon,California, and New Jersey) were sufficient to bring him a majority in theElectoral College. The reason that Lincoln could get an electoral majoritywith only forty percent of the popular vote was not that his opposition wasdivided but that he had far fewer "wasted" votes than his opponents--in tensouthern states he got no popular votes at all.It can of course be argued that the candidate of a united anti-Lincolnopposition might have done better than all the OTL anti-Lincoln candidatescombined, because the mere fact of the divided nature of Lincoln'sopposition might have discouraged anti-Lincoln men and led to fewer ofthem voting than would otherwise be the case. But given that turnout wasquite high in 1860, I doubt this.One thing seems reasonably clear to me: if there was to be a united anti-Lincoln opposition, Douglas could not lead it. He was hated too much inthe South for his opposition to the admission of Kansas as a state underthe pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution and for his interpretation of DredScott as still allowing territories to exclude slavery through unfriendlylocal legislation. (Seefor Douglas's defense of his position.) He and Breckinridge and Bell wouldhave to withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate--former governorHoratio Seymour of New York was one proposal. But I doubt that Seymourwould have been able to do better than all the combined OTL anti-Lincolncandidates in such close states as Illinois and Indiana And his ownstate of New York was not really close enough for me to believe he couldhave taken that state from the Lincoln column.--David Tennerdten...@ameritech.net Joseph T Major :     <QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="    Machiavegli wrote:    -In 1860 there was a four-way race between the Republican Party with Abraham    -Lincold, the Democratic Party with Stephen Douglas, the Southern Democratic    -Party with John Breckenridge, and the Constitutional Union Party with John    -Bell.

===========Input: October's Last Weekend Scott : Again I apologize for the lack of updates over the past few days andwill use this space to recap a weekend that was both good and bad.The Good:On Friday a small group of friends and I attended a most-righteousSister Hazel concert at Floyd's Music Store for the third straight, andfor the third straight year I was blown away by one of my favorite livebands. Sister Hazel has a way of becoming intimate with the fans bybrining them into the show. It's something you can always expect fromthese guys, unlike so many other performers, and is why I never miss ashow when they're in town.On Saturday we hosted what was for the most part a largely successfulHalloween party -- save for the fake blood stains on the carpet andbathroom walls, a couple beer spills, unnecessary fights and theexpected trashing of the kitchen and living room areas. Naturally, Idressed up as Hugh Hefner and took the role of making sure everyone washaving a good time. I have yet to hear any complaints from any of theguests.The Bad:On Saturday the Seminoles were bested by unranked Maryland;effectively ending our chances at a national title this year. Inaddition, the quarterback controversy has once again debouched as ChrisRix almost took us to victory with his deep threat. Alas, too little toolate was the case thanks to the inept Wyatt Sexton who has been ourstarter since replacing Rix earlier in the season. Fortunately the agonyof defeat was blanketed somewhat by our Halloween party and I won't haveto worry about Seminole Football until next Saturday.On Sunday we saw "Saw" (review coming) and as expected I was lessthan satisfied. It was neither better nor worse than last week's "TheGrudge" but the trailers beforehand dictate that the end of this yearand the beginning of 2005 will bring us a large quantity of horrormovies. If I enjoy one out of five considering the genre I can say it'sworth it.

===========Input: They Refuse to Reason Scott : I wish I could have been at a Pub, or wherever these people convene,to see the reactions from all the Britons who read the Telegraph thismorning (emphasis added): Britain's gun laws are aimed at the wrongtarget, curbing and criminalising legal ownership while failing totackle huge rises in shooting offences over the past few years,according to an international firearms legislation expert.Prof Gary Mauser said that Britain was making the same mistake asCanada and Australia in focusing on legal owners - a section of thelaw-abiding community where gun crimes, such as the Dunblane massacre,were aberrations .The Home Office and police chiefs should instead tackle thepossession of guns in criminal hands, said Prof Mauser, a member of theindependent Fraser Institute in Canada. He has given evidence to selectcommittees of the House of Commons and the Canadian Senate and predictedthe escalation of gun crime on Britain's streets.His warning comes as gun crime incidents are averaging about 29 a dayin England and Wales, more than twice the level of when the LabourGovernment came to power in 1997 . In the past two years, there havebeen cases of schoolchildren and a baby, killed or injured by guns."I believe that factors of political correctness are at work," hesaid. "Police crackdowns, Home Office initiatives and over-regulation oflegally held weapons create froth and they may even fool the policethemselves into believing they are doing something about gun crime."Prof Mauser added: "The sad truth is that while the police officersare inspecting farmers' gun cabinets to see if they comply withregulations somewhere in the UK, someone, who has not filled in afirearms certificate form, will be smuggling a gun into the country orselling one to an inner city youth."Recorded gun crime rose by three per cent to 10,590 incidents in theyear to June . Two-thirds of gun crime takes place in London, Birminghamand Manchester. It doesn't matter to these people that crime hasskyrocketed since the irrational ban on private gun possession went intoeffect in Great Britain. Just as long as it's there, they feel safe.

===========Input: Get Off Their Backs Scott : From Reuters : U.S. Marines rallied round a comrade underinvestigation for killing a wounded Iraqi during the offensive inFalluja, saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable,hair-trigger circumstances.Marines interviewed on Tuesday said they didn't see the shooting as ascandal, rather the act of a comrade who faced intense pressure duringthe effort to quell the insurgency in the city."I can see why he would do it. He was probably running around beingshot at for days on end in Falluja. There should be an investigation butthey should look into the circumstances," said Lance CorporalChristopher Hanson."I would have shot the insurgent too. Two shots to the head," saidSergeant Nicholas Graham, 24, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. "You can'ttrust these people. He should not be investigated. He did nothingwrong." Of course the anti-American world press is jumping all over thisstory, casually omitting the fact that just a day earlier the marine inquestion lost a fellow soldier who was attending to a dead insurgentthat was booby-trapped with explosives.Add the tactic of booby-trapping your own dead to the effectivesuicide bombings, and it's clear to say that the Geneva Convention isn'ton the minds of the insurgents. For that I believe the Marines shouldhandle dead and wounded insurgents by any means necessary to ensuretheir own safety and prevent a possible ambush. I'm no fan of this wareither, but it irks me to no end reading and listening to civilianopinions on how soldiers should conduct themselves in hostile war zonesfrom their comfortable recliners.To the world press and everyone else who despises the United States:You don't have to like our president or those operating this war, butget off the backs of the 18, 19 and 20 year-olds thrown into a situationyou will never see or have to encounter. I've got too many friends inIraq right now I want to see come home alive and well, and I willsupport them at every opportunity.

===========Input: Not to be Ignored Scott : More than a few e-mails have come in wondering why I haven't remarkedon the horrible hunting tragedy on Nov. 21 that left six people dead,and why I haven't updated the ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN COUNTER.I didn't mean to wait this long and never intended to ignore theissue, but I have been extremely busy last week with Thanksgiving andeverything that goes along with it. This is problem that needs to beaddressed.But as for the assault weapons ban issue, the man accused of thebrutal killings, Chai Vang of St. Paul, Minn, used a Russian-built Saiga7.62 mm, SKS semiautomatic rifle.As this article points out, the SKS wasn't included on the list ofbanned weapons as part of the 10-year ban on certain "assault weapons"signed by President Clinton. The ban expired in September and at thetime of this posting, no one has been killed by any one of those weaponssince the ban expired.But let's talk about this case, as I'm sure discussions have startedand many want stronger gun control because of this freak incident. Whilethe media use words like "military style," "assault" and"semiautomatic," the gun used in the slayings was not unlike a typicalhunting rifle.The SKS is a medium-powered carbine equipped with a 10-roundmagazine, just like the pistol I'm displaying in the photo on the lefthand side of this blog. Banned weapons had capacities of more than 10rounds; so like my small 9mm, the SKS was not classified as an "assault"weapon. So let's not center our discussion around the gun, let's talkabout the person behind the trigger.If convicted of the killings, Vang faces life in prison as Minnesotadoes not honor the death penalty. I look forward to Vang's convictionand I pray for the families of the victims. What happened wasindefensible and justice must be served.

From BBCNews : A retired Italian doctor has revealed for the first time how heinvented a fictitious disease which fooled the Nazis during World WarII. The trick of prescribing Jews with a mysterious illness terrifiedthe Nazis and saved 45 Roman Jews.Dr Vittorio Sacerdoti has told his remarkable tale on the 60thanniversary of liberation of Rome. Just 28 years old at the time, heused courage and ingenuity to save 45 people from certain death.As other Jews were being rounded up, Dr Sacerdoti admitted anyone whocould reach the hospital as patients - and diagnosed them with adangerous disease."We would write on their medical forms that the patient was sufferingfrom K Syndrome," he said. "We called it K after the German commanderKesserling - the Nazis thought it was cancer or tuberculosis, and theyfled like rabbits."K Syndrome saved his cousin, Luciana Sacerdoti, who was just 10 yearsold."The day the Nazis came to the hospital, someone came to our room andsaid: 'You have to cough, you have to cough a lot because they areafraid of the coughing, they don't want to catch an awful disease andthey won't enter'."

===========Input: It's Just Armor Scott : Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld took part in a Q&amp;A with thetroops today that was anything but cozy. Disgruntled soldiers complainedto Rumsfeld about long deployments and a lack of armored vehicles andother equipment. From the Associated Press : "You go to war with theArmy you have," Rumsfeld replied, "not the Army you might want or wishto have."Spc. Thomas Wilson had asked the defense secretary, "Why do wesoldiers have to dig through local landfills for pieces of scrap metaland compromised ballistic glass to up-armor our vehicles?" Shouts ofapproval and applause arose from the estimated 2,300 soldiers who hadassembled to see Rumsfeld."We do not have proper armored vehicles to carry with us north,"Wilson, 31, of Nashville, Tenn., concluded after asking again.Wilson, an airplane mechanic whose unit, the 278th Regimental CombatTeam of the Tennessee Army National Guard, is about to drive north intoIraq for a one-year tour of duty, put his finger on a problem that hasbedeviled the Pentagon for more than a year. Rarely, though, is it putso bluntly in a public forum.Rumsfeld said the Army was sparing no expense or effort to acquire asmany Humvees and other vehicles with extra armor as it can. What ismore, he said, armor is not the savior some think it is."You can have all the armor in the world on a tank and a tank can(still) be blown up," he said. Can't say that's the most comfortinganswer.

===========Input: Protect Yourself Not in San Francisco Scott : From the Associated Press : City residents will vote next year on aproposed weapons ban that would deny handguns to everyone except lawenforcement officers, members of the military and security guards.If passed next November, residents would have 90 days to give upfirearms they keep in their homes or businesses. The proposal wasimmediately dismissed as illegal by a gun owners group.Firearms would be allowed only for police officers, security guards,members of the military, and anyone else "actually employed and engagedin protecting and preserving property or life within the scope of his orher employment," according to the measure.Gun Owners of California, a Sacramento-based lobbying group, quicklycalled the ban illegal. Sam Paredes, the group's executive director,said state law bars local governments from usurping the state'sauthority to regulate firearms."The amazing thing is they are going to turn San Francisco intoground zero for every criminal who wants to profit at their chosenprofession," Paredes said.Washington, D.C., is the only major American city that currently banshandgun possession by private citizens. Andrew Arulanandam, director ofpublic affairs for the National Rifle Association, said San Franciscowould be remiss to use that city as a model."If gun control worked, Washington, D.C., would be the beacon.However, it's the murder capital of the United States," he said.If approved, the weapons ban would take effect in January 2006. Quoteof the day: "Firearms would be allowed only for police officers,security guards, members of the military, and anyone else actuallyemployed and engaged in protecting and preserving property or lifewithin the scope of his or her employment."So preserving property or life within the scope of self-defense andprotection of the home is not allowed. No thanks. If the people vote forthis measure it will be hard to sympathize with them when robbery andrape rates skyrocket, because burgulars will know homes are not guarded,and rapists will know the only thing stopping them from the victim theydesire is their own inhibitions.

It's possible, now that San Francisco officialshave proposed a law that mimics the infamous DC gun ban. ColumnistMichelle Malkin is one of the few columnists/bloggers who has picked upon the story.As I said in a previous post it's all up to the voters.

===========Input: Woman Charged With Murder, Kidnapping Fetus-Thingy Scott : From the Associated Press : A baby girl who had been cut out of hermother's womb was found after a frantic search, and authorities arrestedthe woman they say strangled the mother and stole the child. The babywas in good condition Saturday.Lisa M. Montgomery, 36, of Melvern, Kan., was arrested later Fridayand charged with kidnapping resulting in death. Bobbie Jo Stinnett, 23,was found Thursday in a pool of blood inside her small white home inSkidmore, a town in northwest Missouri.Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant, had earlier been talkingwith her mother on the phone, and hung up saying a woman she had chattedwith online had just arrived at her door, authorities said.U.S. Attorney Todd Graves said Montgomery contacted Stinnett throughan online message board, and authorities zeroed in on her using computerforensics. Montgomery was seeking to buy a dog from Stinnett, who raisedrat terriers, he said.According to the criminal complaint, Montgomery traveled about 40miles to Topeka, Kan., on Thursday to go shopping. Her husband receiveda call from her saying she had gone into labor and given birth. The nextday, authorities say, Montgomery confessed that she strangled Stinnettfrom behind, cut her open, removed the baby and cut her umbilical cord.I don't understand how we can call this fetus-thing that was ripped froma mother's womb a "child" or "girl" in a society that sanctionspartial-birth abortion. If you can't charge someone for killing a fetusvia abortion during the eighth month, then surely you can't make a bigdeal about a woman who kidnapped a fetus that survived the knifing.On a less-sarcastic note, I pray for the family of the 23-year-oldwoman. No one should have to die because some crazy nut wanted a childand decided to kill for it. If there's any good news in this story, it'sthat Victoria Jo will live on and carry her mother's memory. Questionfor the pro-choicers: Being that it isn't yet the ninth month, can westill charge the killer with kidnapping?

===========Input: Democrats Finally Getting it Right on Abortion? Scott : This is absolutely amazing news. Finally, the Democrats are finallyrealizing that the American people support the rights of unborn childrenand may soon revamp their platform to accommodate the morals and valuesthat at least half of this country possesses. Of course, I'm sure theDemocrats would also like to start winning elections again. From the LosAngeles Times : After long defining itself as an undisputed defender ofabortion rights, the Democratic Party is suddenly locked in an internalstruggle over whether to redefine its position to appeal to a broaderarray of voters.The fight is a central theme of the contest to head the DemocraticNational, particularly between two leading candidates: former VermontGov. Howard Dean, who supports abortion rights, and former Indiana Rep.Tim Roemer, an abortion foe who argues that the party cannot reboundfrom its losses in the November election unless it shows more toleranceon one of society's most emotional conflicts. No Democrat with anyrespect for his unraveling party would ever mention Howard Dean's nameagain. The fact that he didn't win a single primary outside his homestate shows that the country does not embrace his radical liberalism.Of course outspoken organizations such as Planned Parenthood, whichgives a lot of money to Democrats, will fight with everything they'vegot to keep the Democratic platform as liberal as possible.Results from the last few elections suggest that wouldn't be such agood idea if they ever want to gain more power in Congress.

Manning is all class and ranks with the best quarterbacks ofall time. Marino's 48 TD record was set in 1984.On a much sadder note, the Minister of Defense, Reggie White, died ofheart attack this morning in his home at the age of 43. White played atotal of 15 years with Philadelphia, Green Bay and Carolina. He retiredafter the 2000 season as the NFL's all-time leader in sacks with 198.The mark has since been passed by Bruce Smith.White will surely be missed.

Liberal feminist organizations rushed to Yates' defense,most notably the National Organization for Women, which provided moneyfor her defense fund and held candlelight vigils. No such ceremonieswere held for her five dead children.In 2002 a jury sentenced Yates to life in prison for the deaths ofthree of her children. She was not tried in the deaths of the other two.Today the 1st Court of Appeals overturned the convictions and ordered anew trial. We can only hope for the same verdict.

===========Input: Now We'll Just Kill Boys Scott : The blood red nation of China is trying to curb the effects of adevastating 20-year-old policy that outlawed women from having more thanone child. As a result, only about 100 girls are born for every 119boys, because couples traditionally favor males.Beijing has set a goal of reversing the imbalance by 2010, and to dothis they will outlaw the selective abortion of female fetuses tocorrect an imbalance in the ratio of boys to girls. So now by killingthe males they can hopefully narrow the gender gap. What a country!From Reuters : Sex-selective abortion is already banned buttechnologies such as ultrasound have made it easier to know a baby'sgender in advance, increasing the chances for aborting girls.Despite a desire to curb the sex imbalance and a relaxation in recentyears that allows rural families to have two children if the first is agirl, China has shown no sign of abandoning the one-child policy andcracks down on those who advocate against it.One such activist is Mao Hengfeng, who was dismissed in 1988 from herjob at a Shanghai soap factory after becoming pregnant a second time.Last April, the Shanghai public security bureau sentenced her to 18months in a labor camp for campaigning against the one-child policy. Inother news: feminists still believe they're second-class citizens in theUnited States.

FromSun-Sentinal : Two of the three types of free condoms offered by PlannedParenthood received poor ratings, according to rankings that appear inthe February issue of Consumer Reports, which hits newsstands Wednesday.Planned Parenthood has since redesigned its "Honeydew" condom, whichwas the magazine's lowest-ranked brand with two "poor" ratings instrength and reliability. The group resubmitted all three of its brandsfor independent testing and received "excellent results," said KarenPearl, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of NassauCounty. The group's "Assorted Colors" brand was ranked next-to-last witha "poor" mark for strength but an "excellent" for reliability. The"Lollipop" got an overall "excellent" rating. Pretty scary that poorlyrated condoms have been available to teens, both those looking for freesex and those who happen to attend public school. Even worse, it took awhistleblower to get Planned Parenthood to strengthen its product.Lollipop anyone?

Forcing him to acceptunwanted religious beliefs? No wonder you can't win an argument againsta secularist.

With an 89% success rate, we can be optimistic that we are onthe right path to ending unwanted pregnancy that doesn't involve ascalpel or suction tube.Conservatives say people will be less reluctant to have risky andunprotected sex if they've got a box of B under the nightstand wherecondoms traditionally collect.

Overall, 77 percent of respondents said Bush is taking thecountry in the right direction after the speech compared to 67 percentbeforehand.And who wasn't moved by the embrace of mother of a soldier killed inIraq and the daughter of a man killed by Saddam Hussein's regime?

Notthat I was surprised - considering not long ago we were introduced to apeople who proudly donned the "I had an abortion" slogan with greatpride on their t-shirts.The first trackback entry is from the typical anti-Christian variety:Ms. Rytel is absolutely correct, the anti-abortion Christians havemanaged to convice (sic) nearly everyone that abortion is wrong andpeople should feel horribly guilty over it. Like we haven't heard thisrant before. Yes, only the Christians value life when it's a life beforebirth. Of course it would be wrong to make people feel "horribly guilty"over abortion, but celebrating the skull-cracking procedure "for thesake of the child" in the form of t-shirts and jewelry is to be admired.The problem for the pro-abortion movement is that hardly anyone istaking a stand to reverse this societal brainwashing. Even by callingthe movement "pro-choice" instead of "pro-abortion," it gives credenceto the Christian loonies.Here is where I agree with my fellow Libertarian. "Pro-choice" is asoft and weak label for what those people really truly represent. Iprefer pro-murder, anti-life or anti-responsibility as a suitablereplacement.

They have gun laws!And because New York has such strict gun laws - meaning citizens areprohibited from concealing weapons - a gunner can use bag-totingshoppers as target practice because guns laws keep mall shoppers at hismercy.Had an armed civilian been inside the mall, perhaps he could haveintervened before the suspect began injuring people before he ran out ofammo.But not in New York. Because there people like me who have never hadso much as a traffic ticket in life cannot conceal weapons, unlike inFlorida, where you walk past us everyday without even knowing it.

Sponsored by Rep. Dennis Baxley, an OcalaRepublican, the bill (HB 249) passed 13-0.State law defines deadly force as that which is likely to cause"death or great bodily harm," such as firing a gun at a person or avehicle.Florida courts consider deadly force a last resort and have held thata person being attacked has the "duty to use every reasonable means toavoid the danger, including retreat, prior to using deadly force."But this legislation says a person who is under attack in a publicplace "has no duty to retreat.""Law-abiding people should not be told that if they are attacked,they should turn around and run," NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer toldlawmakers. "This bill gives back rights that have been eroded and takenaway by a judicial system that at times appears to give preferentialtreatment to criminals."Baxley held up a stack of more than 800 e-mails from Floridians whohe said have written him to support the bill. He said 62 House members,a majority, have endorsed his bill, and supporters include AttorneyGeneral Charlie Crist and groups representing Florida sheriffs, policechiefs and police officers.Rep. Jeff Kottkamp, R-Cape Coral, said the bill reminded him of asign he saw on a constituent's house while campaigning door-to-door.Kottkamp said the sign, next to a doorbell, showed a smoking .44-Magnumhandgun and the words: "We don't dial 911." This is great news forFlorida gun carriers because now to defend yourself you don't have tofirst make sure a "duty to retreat" is impossible. Currently, if one'slife is threatened he/she must make sure it is impossible to escapebefore using deadly force on an attacker.

Nice.I wouldn't be surprised if this Arroyo character (who was killed bypolice as he tried to flee) had a serious criminal past but has beenallowed to walk free due to our lax judicial process.Should this be a call for more gun control?Absolutely not. This case tells us two things: that concealed weaponspermit holders respond faster than police because we are in greaternumbers, and that criminals wear body armor too - so it's ridiculous toclaim that we should outlaw guns that are "too powerful" for civilianuse.Perhaps someone with a Five-seveN (the gun the Brady Campaign callsthe "cop-killer" and is trying to ban) could have been more effective atstopping the armor-wearing gunner.God bless you, Mark Wilson, 52, a true patriot who died today tryingto stop this despicable maniac.

But the Old Dominion has come a long way, in my humbleopinion, when the biggest campaign contributor in the state is AfricanAmerican.You know we've come along way when African Americans aren't justwinning elected office, as former Gov. Douglas Wilder did, but they'rebankrolling candidates for office-- white candidates for office.Johnson's donations last year included $287,490 for Domocraticgubernatorial hopeful Tim Kaine.

===========Input: Economic Development Accountability? Will Vehrs : The Augusta Free Press (motto: "Our only agenda is the truth") has aChris Graham story on a Del. Chap Peterson, D-Fairfax, bill that wouldrequire payback by companies lured to Virginia by incentives if they donot stay for five years. The text of HB2898 is here .Peterson, of course, is a candidate for the Lt. Governor nomination.Graham's article has the interesting hook of quoting one of Peterson'srivals, former Congresswoman and State Sen. Leslie Byrne, as approvingof the measure because it's "something that I've been talking about forsome time now."The Virginia Economic Developers Association has not taken a stanceon the bill, but the organization's leadership is expected to meettomorrow to discuss it. Demanding accountability from economicdevelopment is a rare phenomenon. I would expect them to oppose it.If anybody would like to debate the merits of this proposal ordiscuss economic development in general, the comment section is open.PS One of our Bacons Rebellion contributors, Steven Sisson, offersthis testimonial: "Without a doubt, The Augusta Free Press is the bestthing since sliced bread!" Hey, what's this blog, chopped liver? Jim Bacon : If I recall correctly, the last time that Virginia seriouslyaddressed the "incentives" issue was during the Allen administration.The idea then was to peg incentives to performance: If the touted jobsand investment don't materialize, you lose the tax breaks andincentives. By demanding accountability, Peterson's bill is in thespirit of Virginia's existing policy, thought perhaps somewhat tougher. Steven Sisson : Will Verhrs wrote: "Hey, what's this blog, chopped liver?"I'm not a certifiable Blogophile yet.In my estimation, the Bacon's Rebellion blog is nothing more than"Bacon Bits" but don't blog me wrong, because I love bacon bits onsalads.The same might be said of Chap's condiment-packaged business bill.Delegate Chap Petersen bill is nothing more than salt and pepperelectioneering in the 2005 statewide campaign -- and is probably tiedinto the Democratic outsourcing clamor and growing threat of moremanufacturing plants closing, which John Kerry politically contrived andsensationalized for the 04 presidential run.Residents throughout the commonwealth of Virginia and the rest of thenation are economically vulnerable due to free trade agreements and theglobal economy. But both parties are responsible and have voted in favorof those agreements.Lt. Governor candidate's Chap Peterson and Leslie Byrne are both goodpoliticians, but need to start thinking outside the box with legislationthat will attract and benefit economic growth for the business world andcreate sustainable workplaces for Virginians.Will, I agree with your analysis, the VA business community alongwith a majority of GA members will probably deep-six this 5-yearmandatory requirement for compensation due to relocation.If not bordering on the political ridorkulous (ridiculously dorky),it's just plain ludicrous to believe business owners would agree to acapital investment with strings attached to the businesses health andlongevity.Reward-to-punishment-to-reward maybe good dog training techniques,but it's not very business friendly.The Commonwealth needs legislation that requires a mandatory EmployeeStock Ownership Plan (ESOP) within the contractual economic developmentagreements. The ESOP is itself a corporate finance vehicle that providesmonetary incentives with lending institutes, state and federal taxbenefits, new capital investment, and most of all, the stock ownershipplan increases VA employee capital wealth.More capital wealth will drive our consumer-base economy through theflipping roof.But most importantly, how many Virginia businesses will choose torelocate -- or outsource when employee are the corporate stockowners?And lets say the business has no other choice but to remove to the thirdworld ...When Virginia's employees are fully vested in company stock, theywill also reap from the profits of lower wages in the global marketplacejust like the corporate big boys.It's Win-Win -- sort of. Phil Rodokanakis : Steve Sisson said: "Lt. Governor candidate's Chap Peterson and LeslieByrne are both good politicians..."Define what makes a "good politician!" If one defines being on theextreme liberal fringe of the Democart party as good, than Byrne surelyqualifies under that label. Peterson is slightly to the right of Byrne,but not by much...Frankly, I don't consider tax and spend liberals as good politicians.Unfortunately, the Republican Party is also loaded with its share ofirresponsible big spenders, but hopefully some of them will be heldaccountable during the 2005 primary elections. On the other hand, I haveyet to see any Democrats challenge incumbents for being fiscallyirresponsible. Scott : Accountbility is important. I hope Wilder will return it to Richmond.For years we have seen abuse by 'public-private' partnerships likeRichmond Renaissance and now VPAF. I would like to see the bill appliedto the shady Broad Street CDA.

The gift, payableover three years, is the largest ever given the university by an activefaculty member, according to UVA President John Casteen. Sabato haswritten 23 books. Some of them have been read!Mostly lifted from the Associated Press Jim Bacon : That's pretty darn generous. Was it HIS money? Will Vehrs : I'm not ashamed to say that I'm in the tank for Professor Sabato. Hemaintains his political independence as well as any pundit and thisdonation affirms that the words he's always used to describe hiscommitment to UVA are genuine. He could have moved on to any number oftv or print opportunities, but has stayed in Charlottesville to continuehis good works.I'd suggest Wahoos disenchanted with Pete Gillen rally around Sabatoas the embodiment of their university's excellence.

===========Input: Other Voices Will Vehrs : With no web presence, publications like the Richmond Free Press arerarely acknowledged in the blogosphere. The RFP serves theAfrican-American community in the City of Richmond.In the latest edition, staff writer Jeremy M. Lazarus reports thatthe Legislative Black Caucus celebrated killing a bill that would havemerged the Department of Minority Business Enterprise (DMBE) with theDepartment of Business Assistance (DBA). Del. Dwight Jones (D-Richmond),chair of the caucus, said killing the bill had been their "mainobjective" in an effort to, according to Lazarus, "promote economicjustice for black businesses."I believe any neutral management consultant worth his or her saltwould recommend a merger of the two organizations. There is considerableduplication of effort and DBA is strong in one area--financialcontrols--where DMBE has consistently had problems. There would beservice benefits to business clients, too. Nonetheless, the symbolism ofhaving their "own" agency and support from Governor Warner formaintaining DMBE's "independence" apparently overcame any efficiency andservice argument.Another article, this one by staff writer Skeeter Faulk, describesSen. George Allen's commitment to naming the new Federal courthouse indowntown Richmond for Spottswood W. Robinson III, a noted NAACP lawyerand federal judge. Robinson worked with Thurgood Marshall on Brown v.Board of Education . Faulk finds the nomination a "surprise" in light ofAllen's past, when he "embraced and glorified the Confederate flag andits sympathizers." Faulk chalks the naming up to Allen's presidentialambitions.It's tough to be a Republican when it comes to the African-Americancommunity. Do nothing and you confirm their worst suspicions; dosomething and it arouses a different kind of suspicion. Jim Bacon : Will, I share your frustration at the reaction to Allen's nod toSpottswood Robins. Among some segments of the African-Americancommunity, it is indeed a matter of damned-if-you-do,damned-if-you-don't. But you could say the same thing of the DemocraticParty as a whole.I think it's important to recognize that African Americans, thoughstill overwhelmingly Democratic, comprise less of a monolith than theydid 20-30 years ago. I find myself continually amazed at how open-mindedmany young African-Americans are. And I think that open-mindedness goesa long way to explain the desperate efforts of many (not all, but many)within the Democratic Party to circle the wagons with the cry of"racism, racism, racism" when the evidence of racism is increasingly astretch. It's like how, after the Civil War, Republicans "waved thebloody shirt", associating the Democratic Party with the secession and,ultimately, the war itself. Eventually, that tactic lost its power. Andso, too, will the cries of racism, racism. Scott : Agreed.More importantly, the lack of disclosure is frightening. MediaGeneral/Times Dispatch, Richmond.com, and the Richmond Free Press allhave significant ties to the VPAF's proposed Virginia Performing ArtsCenter, yet we do not see anything resembling balanced coverage of thecontroversy and debate surrounding this issue.

Mickey Kaus in Slatewas listening: Here's how NPR's All Things Considered covered PresidentBush's proposed cuts in Community Development Block Grants --by lobbingsoftballs to a CDBG supporter! No opposing view. ... This is not justliberal, but dumb liberal--NPR could easily have found a Democrat, maybeeven an old Democrat, who believed CDBGs are an ineffective antipovertyprogram. (Basically they are slush funds for local politicians, who toooften sluice the federal money to their developer friends to build uglydowntown hotels.) It's my sense that in Virginia, the CDBG program isused extensively in rural areas and, on the whole, has done some good.Maybe someone knows of CDBG funds used in Virginia as Mickey describes.I hope not, but, if so, it looks like there won't be as much of that inthe future.

===========Input: Kaine on Death and Taxes Jim Bacon : by Steven SissonChoir boy Tim Kaine is a political moderate informed by his Catholicbeliefs. But look for the Kilgore team to paint him as a liberal for hisrecord on tax hikes and the death penalty.The Blue Dog personally views Lt. Gov. Tim Kaine as amoderate-to-conservative politician. Kaine has never been an AmwayChristian, nor does he hold a lifetime membership to the C-E Club (i.e.,only attending church service on Christmas and Easter holidays). More Anonymous : Kaine a "moderate to conservative"? Who is this guy trying to kid?Kaine is as liberal as they come. Who other than a left-wing liberalwould agree to represent a two-time murderer (Lem Tugle) for free, totry and keep him from getting the death penalty. Tugle was on trial forraping and killing a southwest Virginia grandmother. After killing her,he dumped her body down the same ditch where he dumped the 17-year-oldgirl he had previously been convicted of murdering. Tugle was on parolefor this crime when he killed the grandmother.I understand that representing people is what attorneys do but evenattorneys have some choice in whom they represent. The line of defenseKaine used was that Tugle had not really raped the grandmother because"forcable sodomy was not rape according to the law at the time."

===========Input: Car Tax Cut Acceleration Hits a Wall Barnie Day : As expected the Senate Finance Committee this afternoon killed aproposal by House Republicans to finish implementation of the car taxcut by phasing out the remaining 30% over the next six years. The moveleaves intact state reimbursement for the locally-imposed property taxat an aggregate of $950 million annually. At present, that amount coversapproximately 70% of the tax for the average affected car owner. Thecommitee action comes two days before House and Senate budget confereesare expected to begin negotiating differences in the respectiveproposals. Phil Rodokanakis : Yep, like I said before, it's either Chichester's way or the highway.It's simply mind-boggling that Chichester is allowed to single-handedlygovern our entire state.I hate to shatter your illusions Barnie. Your chum, Gov. Pinocchio,is not in-charge of the State. Chichester is new our master... Will Vehrs : What if Chichester had been elected Lt. Gov, instead of Wilder, allthose years ago?

I suppose that's not materially different from your report, butBlack wanted a recorded vote and didn't get it.It's not a profile in courage to avoid a recorded vote. Paul : Certainly not - but I think it trumps giving Black satisfaction ofbeing able to slap the "anti-family!" on tolerant legislators. Scott : What's important to realize is that Black's "scientists" were givenno credence whatsoever. They lacked credibilty. The failure of this billwas a small glimmer of hope in what has been a dismal season.

===========Input: Anti-Gerrymandering: Is Virginia Ready? Will Vehrs : Many of the good-governiks who write for Bacon's Rebellion havepointed out the deleterious effects of gerrymandering on Virginia. Somewould say the problems are on display in Capitol Square right now.There's an anti-gerrymandering movement gaining a small head of steamin California. The Golden State often leads the way for the nation on"reform," for good or ill. Mickey Kaus of Slate reminds us that theCalifornia initiative bears watching and we should follow the motives ofthose who support or oppose the current redistricting process.Mickey cites two Stuart Taylor articles on the subject that should berequired reading for any who would debate the issue, here and here . Barnie Day : Hand in hand with any consideration of the redistricting process, weshoul give some thought to the structural relationship between the stateHouse and Senate. Currently, each House member represents approximately75,000 Virginians, while each Senator represents appoximately 187,500.Often as not, there is no rational commonality between the two. Somesenators represent people pools that are in turn fractured into five orsix House districts. I believe this accounts, in large part, for thedysfunction that characterizes our state government now. Former GovernorGerald Baliles, in this same vein, has advocated a realignment of thetwo houses in a way that serves commonalities. He has suggested that weeither increase membership in the Senate to 50, or decrease Housemembership to 80, producing a scenario wherein 1 Senator would representa block of people who are represented by exactly 2 Delegates. Hethinks--and I think he is right--that this arrangement would foster acloser working relationship between the Senate and the House. Youcertainly wouldn't have these dysfunctional groupings we now have, where1 Senator often represents a population divided among half a dozenDelegates of two parties--three, if you count independents.

SCHEV, ofcourse, told the General Assembly that UVA-Wise didn't generate anyeconomic development, so a new university in Southside wouldn't, either.The Courier said Wise should get the center over Danville becausethere's no Southside university. No other candidate locations wereidentified.I believe that any new state-wide service facilities should belocated in either Southside or Southwest. If we can tie up all stateprocurement officials and all vendors in a quest to helpunder-represented small, minority, and woman-owned businesses, we shouldcommit all new state facility spending in a quest to help oureconomically disadvantaged regions.

===========Input: Two Reactions, Two Worlds Will Vehrs : Del. Adam Ebbin (D, Alexandria) is the first openly gay member toserve in the House of Delegates. There's a brief profile of Ebbin byKristen Gelineau in today's Daily Press . What I found interesting wasthe contrast in reactions to Ebbin from two colleagues: "I suppose thatone of the concerns was that since he is the only openly gay member ofthe Legislature, is whether or not that would be the only issue that hewould ... talk about," said Del. Ward Armstrong, D-Henry County. "Thatclearly has not been the case. He is a very versatile delegate."Del. Richard Black, R-Loudoun, who has compiled a track record as oneof the most socially conservative members of the state legislature andwas the sponsor of the gay adoption bill, said he's not trying to stampout gay rights but is simply trying to preserve tradition.As for his personal feelings on Ebbin, after a lengthy pause, theLoudoun Republican offered: "He's always prompt and, you know, on timeto meetings." A moment later, he added, "I think he works hard." I thinkit's possible to support some of Black's positions but still be verydisappointed by his cold assessment of a colleague. Paul : Dick Black is a statesman. Salt Lick : Odd how different our perceptions are. I read Black's comment as moregenuine and straightforward than Armstrong's. I'd much rather someonecall me "prompt" and "hard-working" than "very versatile." The lattersounds like weasel words -- "Well," Johnnie's teacher said, "he's nottoo bright, and his table manners are atroctious, but he's veryversatile." Will Vehrs : Maybe it was the pointed reference of the reporter to the pausesBlack made that troubled me.I appreciate your take on it; that's why I love this comment section.I may be way off-base.

===========Input: Virginia's Anti-Immigrant Voice Will Vehrs : An old friend, Joseph Britt of Kennesaw, GA, recently emailed to askabout anti-immigration as an issue for Virginia Democrats. Joe had justread a George W. Grayson article in the William &amp; Mary Alumni Magazine ," Myths About Illegal Immigration ."Grayson does not cite any Virginia examples, but among the "myths" heattempts to explode are that illegal immigrants perform jobs Americansdon't want and that they contribute more in taxes and social securitythan they take from government programs. Jim Bacon : I personally know a good number of immigrants, both legal andillegal. One fellow, a Brazilian, has done everything by the book. Hegets rewarded by having to pay an immigration attorney thousands ofdollars while getting yanked around by the Immigration Service... not tomention, he's paying the government thousands in taxes. He gets veryfrustrated because many of his contemporaries work for cash under thetable. They aren't paying lawyers, and they pay nothing into the system.Of course, the Americans who employ illegal immigrants are happy to payin cash because it means cheaper labor for them.Who benefits? The illegal immigrants themselves, of course. Theemployers who hire them instead of raising wages to attract native-bornAmericans and legal immigrants. And families who hire cheap domesticlabor, whether to clean the house, wash the laundry or maintain thelawn. Who loses? Poor, native-born Americans who otherwise would be paidhigher wages for their manual labor. Legal immigrants like my Brazilianfriend, who sometimes feels like a sap for playing by the rules. And therest of us who won't hire anyone to work for us unless they're payingtheir taxes, even if it means we pay more.Yeah, I've got a problem with turning around and giving illegalimmigrants all the rights and privileges of the native born and thelegal immigrants who've played by the rules. Yes, I do.

===========Input: Where is Investigative Journalism? Will Vehrs : Governor Mark Warner has turned state government upside-down in aneffort to do more business with small, women, and minority owned (SWAM)firms and the thanks he gets are headlines like this one in the DailyPress : Warner's plan to raise contracting diversity falls short .The article is full of innuendo that procurement officals areignoring the Governor's wishes and just waiting for him to leave office,that "special deals" are cut with non-SWAM vendors, and that somehow theelectronic procurement system is "stacked" against SWAM firms. If true,these are serious charges, worthy of high-level investigation.What's missing from the article, though, is any attempt atinvestigative journalism to give even one factual example supporting theinnuendo. What's also missing is a fair-minded review of whether thesagging numbers reported for SWAM procurement are valid.Someday a journalist is going to take the time to watch a samplenumber of SWAM firms submit bids on openly posted contracts, then useprocurement tools that are in place to determine if any SWAM firms wereunfairly denied contracts they deserved. Until then, this carpingappears to be sour grapes. Governor Warner has done plenty to open upthe system to SWAM firms and give them a presumptive advantage, eveninviting a backlash by non-SWAM firms. Maybe SWAM firms aren't doing allthey can to return the Governor's faith in them. Jim Bacon : The dominant narrative among the Mainstream Media, even at a locallevel, is that the institutions of U.S. society are, to varying degrees,racist. Any shortcomings in minority achievement are to be explained asthe result of discrimination of some sort. End of story. What's toinvestigate? What need to examine "the other side of the story?"

===========Input: Arafat Dead at Last Curt : Welcome all to my new site. I've decided to incorporate my old workblog into a general blog, the work diary is up on the right titled "mywork diary".EFF YEAH! BUSH WON!OK then. My next thought.The world is a much better place now that the terrorist Yassar Arafatis dead. Here is a good one minute video on his great legacy Here . Thisguy was one of the early innovators of terrorism in this century and heis protrayed by the Main Stream Media (MSM for short) as a "freedomfighter". Because of him millions of palestinians chose "jihad" overpeace with Isreal. He innovated suicide bombers and plane hijacking plushe embezzelled hundreds of millions of dollars from aid funds....andthis guy got a nobel peace prize, what a disgrace.UPDATE 1 - Drudge is reporting that Arafat has been skimming 2million a month from the gasoline trade in the territoriesMAG: Arafat Skimmed $2 Million a Month From the Gas Trade Sun Nov 142004 09:53:40 ETNew York-- Last year auditors discovered Arafat was guilty of skimming $2million a month from the gasoline trade in the territories, TIMEreports.In August 2002 international donors forced Arafat to sign overhis investments to the Palestine Investment Fund, which was audited byU.S. accountants and managed by Palestinian Finance Minister SalamFayyad, a former International Monetary Fund official.After scouring corporations throughout the Arab world and bankaccounts in the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg, the auditors identified$800 million, which has been made a part of the Palestinian Authority'sofficial budget. It's the most successful financial reform in the Arabworld, -- Jim Prince, president of the Los Angeles-based Democracy Counciland head of the audit team, tells TIME.People close to Fayyad's investigation told TIME of Arafat's skimmingfrom the gas trade. Breaking the gasoline smuggling and corruptionboosted the Palestinian Authority's official treasury by $10 million amonth and cut gas prices for ordinary Palestinians."Arafat's death meanshis followers may never know just how much more they may be owed,"writes TIME's Matt Rees in "Where's Arafat's Money?"In the mid-1990s, Arafat controlled a financial empire worth at least$3 billion. By the time of his death, he was down to his last $1billion, according to Israeli-intelligence estimates.Arafat wife Suha'soutburst that his successors were "trying to bury [him] alive" cameafter she learned that Arafat had signed over at least $800 million tothe government of the Palestinian Authority two years ago, TIME reports.Top Palestinian officials say Suha wants the new chief of the P.L.O.,Mahmoud Abbas, and Palestinian prime minister Ahmed Qurei to give hermoney out of the P.L.O.'s party coffers. But a senior P.L.O. officialtells TIME, "they'll pay her a pension, and that's it." People familiarwith Arafat's finances say the Palestinian leader sent Suha $200,000 amonth out of the Palestinian Authority's budget for the Office of thePresident.French authorities are investigating transfers of $15 million fromSwiss banks to Paris accounts in Suha's name at the Arab Bank and at BNPParibas Bank, a French bank, TIME reports.Senior Palestinian securityofficials tell TIME that Arafat also shipped money to the gunmen of theAqsa Martyrs Brigades.Developing... Sure sounds like a Nobel Prize winner to me.

===========Input: James Baker, The New Village Idiot Curt : Thanks to Captain Ed for bringing this up. Apparently James Baker,former Secretary of State and current envoy for the Bush Administration,has asked the Isreali government to release a scumbag terrorist topromote "peace". There is now. . . . in an Israeli prison a man namedMarwan Barghouti, who is one of the young guard of Palestinians, and ifthe Palestinians are going to make this work against the reallyhard-line elements, the Islamists and some of the people of Hamas,they're going to have to have a coalition of the young guard and the oldguard." Gotta say that this shocked me, I've always thought Mr. Bakerwas a upstanding guy but this is just plain good old fashioned bullcrap.Here are some of the fine achievements of the terrorist MarwanBarghouti Marwan Barghouti (born June 6, 1958) is a Palestinian leaderfrom the West Bank and a leader of the Fatah movement that forms thebackbone of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO). On June 6, 2004, he was sentenced to five lifesentences for five murders of Israeli civilians and 40 yearsimprisonment for attempted murders in terrorist attacks against Israelicivilians. Barghouti was one of the major leaders of the First Intifadain 1987, leading Palestinians in a mass uprising against Israelioccupation of the West Bank. During the uprising, he was arrested byIsrael and deported to Jordan, where he stayed for seven years until hewas permitted to return under the terms of the Oslo Accords in 1994. In1996, he was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council, in which headvocated peace with Israel, sometimes coming in conflict with YasserArafat. The formal position occupied by Barghouti was the GeneralSecretary of Fatah in the West Bank.By the summer of 2000, Barghouti and Arafat had grown increasingly atodds with each other, with Barghouti accusing Arafat's administration ofcorruption and his security services of human rights violations, andArafat was planning to fire him shortly.However, as the Second Intifada began, Barghouti became increasinglypopular as a leader of the Fatah Tanzim militia. This was perhaps due tothe transformation of Tanzim into an organization more resemblingmilitant groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, responsible for dozens ofcivilian deaths in drive-by shootings. Under Barghouti, the Tanzim hasalso carried out suicide bombings in Israel under the name al-AqsaMartyrs' Brigades.What is he thinking? Release a known terrorist to run the PLO andthat will bring about peace, give me a effin break

These arethe same terrorists blowing up families, chopping off heads ofcivilians, and the complete disregard for any human life and they justdisagree with us?Tell that to the family of Margaret Hassan, the school teacher whowas brutally tortured and then slaughtered by these same guys, theyain't so bad are they Chris Matthews? This women who was known for her30 years of work in Iraq, distributing medicine, food and supplies toIraqis suffering under the sanctions of the 1990s.British officials say they believe Hassan was a blindfolded womanseen being shot in the head by a hooded militant on a video obtained butnot aired by the Arab television station Al-Jazeera. She would be thefirst foreign woman to die in the wave of kidnappings in Iraq. No grouphas claimed responsibility.On Sunday, Marines found the mutilated body of what they believe wasa Western woman on a street in Fallujah during the U.S. assault on theinsurgent stronghold. The body, clothed in what appeared to be a purple,velour dress, was wrapped in a blanket, with a blood-soaked black clothnearby. As of Tuesday night, the U.S. command said the body had not beenidentified.These are the reasons that none of these mothereffers should ever seethe light of day...they need to be all lined up and shot. Torturing thispoor women for what? WHAT? And we should treat them as enemy soldiersunder the Geneva Convention. Last I remember the convention applies tocountries that signed the document and the two countries must havestanding armies with uniforms....the Iraqi military is at our side, theterrorists are not. Since when are terrorists soldiers? They are lowerthen dogs.Finally there is this written by a student of Mrs. Hassan She was myEnglish teacherIn the memory of my teacher and a fellow aid worker colleague Mrs. M.HassanMrs. Hassan was my English teacher in The British Council in Baghdadin Al-Wazirya district, I remember her years ago with her Irish accenttelling me it's not Important how many words I must learn but thepronunciation of the words I already knew must be perfected.Mrs. Hassan speak s perfect Arabic and she has a heart of gold, she'sbeen killed by (men in pajamas), turn Iraq upside down and find them.The Marines will find them, and when they do they shall die.

===========Input: Allies Curt : 2Slick pointed me to a article at In Iraq For 365 . This is a greatblog and I encourage you all to read it regularly. On Sunday he wrote oftwo Iraqi soldiers who didn't see us as conquerors but as allies whenthe Mosul bombing occurred. The suicide bomb sprayed bb-like fragmentsthroughout the Marez dining facility. One piece of shrapnel slicedthrough the femoral artery of a U.S. soldier and his only chance forsurvival was in the hands of these two Iraqis.Recalling the medical classes they'd received from the specialforces, the Iraqis reacted calmly, fastening a belt above the wound,creating a tourniquet, which stopped the gushing stream of red. Theymoved the soldier to a MEDVAC vehicle via two-man litter carry. Afterthey hoisted the soldier in the truck, the two Iraqis -- one an officer,the other an NCO -- ran back to the facility and began treating the otherwounded without regard for their safety.When the dust settled and the mess tent had been evacuated, everybodywho could talk was questioned about their health. When the medics cameto the two Iraqis, the ING soldiers only wanted to know how everybodyelse was. When asked why did they do it, they simply stated, "this wasour duty; we are a team, and we take care of each other." Even theAmericans. No matter what the MSM tries to tell you, there are Iraqi'swho will help the allies, who will fight alongside them and put theirlives at risk to make sure Democracy succeeds in their country. Thisbrings to mind a speech Prime Minister Tony Blair gave recently whilevisiting Iraq. When I meet the people working alongside the UnitedNations--Iraqis in fear of their life every day, because they are tryingto bring freedom and democracy to their people--when I see their courageand their determination and know that they speak for the vast majorityof people in Iraq who want that democracy and freedom, then I know thatwe are doing the right thing. . . .And I will also say this to you: There are people dying in Iraq, butthe reason people are dying is because of the terrorism and theintimidation and the people who are deliberately killing anyone tryingto make this country better.Now what should our response be as an international community? Ourresponse should be to stand alongside the democrats--the people who'vegot the courage to see this thing through--and help them see it through.I've got no doubt at all that that is the right thing for us to do. . ..Sometimes when I see some of the reporting of what's happening inIraq in the rest of the world, I just feel that people should understandhow precious what has been created here is. And those people from thatelectoral commission that I described as the heroes of the newIraq--every day . . . a lot of them aren't living in the Green Zone,they've got to travel in from outside. They do not know at any point intime whether they're going to be subject to brutality or intimidation,even death, and yet they carry on doing it. Now what a magnificentexample of the human spirit--that's the side we should be on.

===========Input: Laser Beam Question Curt : This recent news story is troubling in many different ways. When Ifirst heard of the story I figured it was some wackjob playing with anew toy but now we find out there have been 7 incidents since Christmasfrom the West to East coast. The FBI, concerned that terrorists coulduse lasers as weapons, is investigating why laser beams were directedinto the cockpits of seven airplanes in flight since Christmas.Laser beams can temporarily blind or disorient pilots and possiblycause a plane to crash.The FBI is looking into two incidents in Colorado Springs, Colo., andone each in Cleveland, Washington, Houston, Teterboro, N.J., andMedford, Ore., according to federal and local law enforcement andtransportation officials, some of whom spoke only on condition ofanonymity.A federal law enforcement official, who declined to be identified byname, said Thursday there is no evidence of a plot or terroristactivity. But pilots are troubled by the incidents, and the FBI earlierthis month warned of the possibility that terrorists might use thedevices as weapons."It's not some kid," said Paul Rancatore, a pilot who serves asdeputy chairman of the security committee for the Allied PilotsAssociation. "It's too organized."Loren Thompson, who teaches military technology at GeorgetownUniversity, called it a "rather worrisome development," though he saidexperts would be more puzzled than alarmed."What we're talking about is a fairly powerful visible light laserthat has the ability to lock onto a fast-moving aircraft," Thompsonsaid. "That's not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplusstore."Thompson said a piece of equipment that could do the things the FBIsuspects would be "fairly expensive and fairly sophisticated.""It sounds like an organized effort to cause airline accidents,"Thompson said. Michelle Malkin has a post about this today where someoutlets have stopped selling lasers. Lots of people think that theseindeed might be loonies playing with new Christmas toys but I disagree.These are incidents where the Airplanes were tracked , some as highas 8500 feet. To track a fast moving plane at that altitude would not besome toy you can get from the local wal-mart. In my opinion this isquite alarming.This Isn't Writing, It's Typing has a great post out with a ton ofinfo, some of it quite scary A more frightening scenario is thatterrorists may have obtained a Chinese-produced ZM-87 laser blinderwhich is specifically designed to blind eyesight. The Japanese terroristcult Aum Shinrikyo--which launched the infamous Sarin gas attack on theTokyo subway system in 1995--was discovered to have experimented with theuse of lasers as weapons.According to The Asian Pacific Post, "Cultmembers apparently obtained laser design information from Russianinstitutes they visited and built a laser weapon mounted on a truck.They had planned to use the laser against Tokyo policemen, but the planfailed when the laser malfunctioned during the testing stage."PoliticAlex also has some info on this story also.I found the following report that was presented to Congress recentlyabout the shoulder launched missle threat to airliners, which this mightvery well be a precursor to: Recent events have focused attention on thethreat that terrorists with shoulder fired surface-to-air missiles(SAMs), referred to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS), poseto commercial airliners. Most believe that no single solution exists toeffectively mitigate this threat. Instead, a menu of options may beconsidered, including installing infrared (IR) countermeasures onaircraft; modifying flight operations and air traffic controlprocedures; improving airport and regional security; and strengtheningmissile non-proliferation efforts. Equipping aircraft with missilecountermeasure systems can protect the aircraft even when operating inareas where ground-based security measures are unavailable or infeasibleto implement. However, this option has a relatively high cost, between$1 million and $3 million per aircraft, and the time needed forimplementation does not allow for immediate response to the existingterrorist threat. Procedural improvements such as specific flight crewtraining, altering air traffic procedures to minimize exposure to thethreat, and improved security near airports may be less costly thancountermeasures and could more immediately help deter domestic terroristattacks. However, these techniques by themselves cannot completelymitigate the risk of domestic attacks and would not protect U.S.airliners flying to and from foreign airports.Legislation introduced in the 108th Congress (H.R. 580, S. 311) callsfor the installation of missile defense systems in all turbojet aircraftused in scheduled air carrier service. While this legislation is stillunder consideration, Homeland Security appropriations designated $60million in FY2004 and $61 million in FY2005 to fund a program to developand test prototype missile countermeasure systems for commercialaircraft based on existing military technology. It is anticipated thatat the conclusion of this program, in January 2006, the Department ofHomeland Security will be able to provide a detailed analysis of thesuitability of such systems for use to protect commercial passengeraircraft.

===========Input: Europe Changing Their Tune? Curt : American Future has a link up to a article written in yesterdaysHouston Chronicle. It describes how the European Governments look to bechanging their tune in regards to President Bush. Why you ask? But thereis arguably more to this sea change than just a grumpy acceptance of thestatus quo. From a European perspective, three things are making iteasier to warm to the Bush White House.One is the death of Yasser Arafat. No issue divides Europe and theUnited States more keenly than the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. For thelast few years, Europeans have criticized Bush for failing to put enoughpressure on Israel to get out of the occupied territories and forrefusing to deal with Arafat. That another reason why I respect Bush somuch, his refusal to acknowledge that windbag terrorist Arafat. May herot in hell. But since Arafat's death, Europeans and Americans have beenable to find common ground: supporting Ariel Sharon's withdrawal fromGaza, putting pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold electionsand, covertly, backing Mahmoud Abbas to become the next Palestinianleader.A second reason is Europe's growing worries about Islamic terrorism.The murder in November of Theo van Gogh, a provocative Dutch filmmaker,at the hands of an Islamic militant has been called Europe's 9/11.Though the two events are obviously not fully comparable, it iscertainly true that American conservatives, such as Francis Fukuyama andBernard Lewis, have found a wider audience recently for the idea thatradical Islam is inimical to European traditions of tolerance. You meanthose radical muslims can be kinda nasty sometimes? Get outtahere....Keep doing business like the cowards in Spain and they will morethen likely have their very own 9/11 to cry about. The third force isthe reappearance, albeit in a milder form, of the threat that kept thetrans-Atlantic alliance together for half a century. The Russian bear isgrowling again. The Ukrainian election --- complete with its KGB-stylepoisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud --has reminded European diplomats of Vladimir V. Putin's determination tocontrol his "near abroad." They should be very worried about this item,I believe Putin is slowly sliding Russia back to what it once was.Hopefully our Government isn't asleep at the wheel with this situationeither. There is a personal edge to all this. Just as the snootycontinentals eventually came to admire the gormless Hollywood actor,there is a grudging willingness to rethink some prejudices about theinarticulate Texan.Many European leaders once swallowed the Michael Moore version ofhistory: that Bush was an ignorant interloper who stole the White House.His thumping re-election, however, shows that he represents a large bodyof conservative American opinion.In short, Europeans are getting used to the idea that it is not Bushwho is the exception, but the U.S. itself that is exceptional --- and thatif they want to deal with this exceptional superpower they need to humorit rather than rile it. Strangely enough, this has been Tony Blair'sstrategy all along; it is rapidly becoming the Continent's strategy,too. Couldn't of ended that article any better myself. Get used to itFrance, we ain't going nowhere.

===========Input: Liberal Reporter Taking Kickbacks Curt : Interesting article at the Accuracy In Media website yesterday. Itseems a supposed straight shooting reporter with NBC was taking money tofund a book that is so pro-united nations that its almost sickening toread. (hat tip Clear and Present )One of the hottest stories around, the U.N. corruption scandal, NBChas been out to lunch. Why? Its U.N. reporter has been on the payroll ofthe U.N. lobby. Linda Fasulo, the U.N. correspondent for NBC News andMSNBC, has written a pro-U.N. book, An Insider's Guide to the U.N. ,which reads like the U.N. paid for it. Actually, the pro-U.N. lobby paidfor it. In a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight newsreporter, Fasulo acknowledges Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation and BetterWorld Campaign for "their generous financial support" of her bookproject. She also thanks the Rockefeller Brothers Fund "for helping tofund the project." The book is about "one of the finest and mostimportant governing bodies," she says. Of the U.N. chief, she writeslike a school girl with a crush. "It is hard to find anyone who canmount a serious criticism of [Kofi] Annan's performance as SecretaryGeneral," she claims. His performance is so "impressive" that shewonders if a "cult of personality" has risen up around him. One U.S.official is reported to be "astonished by just how good a SecretaryGeneral Kofi Annan has been." Yup, you read that right. Kofi'sperformance is soooooo impressive. Gag. Guess the democrats have theirown Armstrong conspiracy to deal with.Why would an NBC reporter (who also reports on the U.N. for NationalPublic Radio) take money from the U.N. lobby? Perhaps because longtimeNBC News anchor Tom Brokaw put his stamp of approval on the UNA-USA andBCUN by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 Global LeadershipDinner. Not surprisingly, Brokaw is listed on the Fasulo book jacket assaying it is a "must-read." Another endorsement of the book comes fromBarbara Crossette, former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N. whonow writes for U.N. Wire, a Ted Turner-funded online news service thatcovers the U.N. A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages togloss over Annan's role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. She tries toblame the U.S. and other members of the Security Council for not sendingenough troops to stop it. She admits, however, that, "The Rwandamassacres occurred while Annan was U.N. Undersecretary General forpeacekeeping," and that "After he became SG [Secretary General], Annancommissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggestremedies." Later, "Annan accepted responsibility for failing to act morequickly," she writes. But responsibility for what? The truth is that, asdirector of U.N. peacekeeping, Annan personally refused requests toauthorize U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and preventgenocide. Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detailhow, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, thecommander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to KofiAnnan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandangovernment informant that genocide was being planned. The informantoffered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to beused in the genocide campaign. All that the informant wanted in returnwas protection for himself and his family. But the general needed U.N.authorization to conduct such a raid and save lives. He asked for thatapproval but the answer came back in a now-infamous "genocide fax" fromAnnan's office. It denied authorization for the mission and told himthat he should turn the information provided by the confidential witnessover to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide! Theresult was that the information dried up and the genocide took place.Yup, good ole Kofi told this poor guy to give the secret info over tothe very government that was planning the genocide. What a great guy heis isn't he.Or how about the ongoing prostitution that's going on in the Congo?Now the report comes out today on the Oil for Food scandal.Yeah...this guy is such a good SG. Eff him.The article ends with the following:In an April 30, 2001, Washington Times column, Nat Hentoff noted thatthe media have devoted "scant mention" to the "plain fact that it wasMr. Annan, when he was head of the United Nation's peacekeeping office,who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and theirsympathizers in Rwanda in 1994." It's true, Hentoff said, that the U.N.issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged, to some extent, its role inthe killings. But for five and a half years, he noted, Annan "refused toaccept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr. Gourevitchand others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stoppedthe killings if Mr. Annan had not closed his eyes." It is astonishingthat a journalist for NBC New would close her eyes to Annan's role. Butthat is what she was apparently paid to do.

===========Input: France  &  Terrorism Curt : Gotta hate the French, I really don't think there is anything goodyou can say about the French anymore, they are a waste and a joke of agovernment.Apparently Bush wants the European's to classify Hezbollah as aterrorist group. Makes sense right?As rising instability in Lebanon increases tensions in the MiddleEast, the Bush administration is arguing with European governments overwhether they should designate the Lebanon-based Shiite group Hezbollah aterrorist organization, American and European officials say.The United States is already stepping up pressure on Iran and Syria,Hezbollah's main sponsors. The American rift with Syria deepened thisweek, with suspicions that Syria might have been behind theassassination of Lebanon's former prime minister in Beirut on Monday....In the past two weeks, the officials said, France has rebuffedappeals by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Israeli foreignminister, Silvan Shalom, to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization,which would prevent it from raising money in Europe through charitygroups. The United States has long called Hezbollah a terroristorganization, but the French, American and European officials said, haveopposed doing so, and argue that making such a designation now would beunwise, given the new turbulence in Lebanon. Israeli and Americanofficials say that the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has toldthem that he, too, regards Hezbollah as a destructive force in theMiddle East, one determined to undermine peace talks by supportingmilitant groups that attack Israelis. Gotta love that. The Palestinianpresident admits that Hezbollah are a bunch of f-wad terrorists but theFrench don't agree....No joke.The Europeans are not solidly opposed to listing Hezbollah as aterrorist group, the officials said. The Netherlands, Italy and Polandsupport the Bush administration's view, several officials said, whileGermany and Britain believe the issue is moot unless the French changetheir minds. One European diplomat said other countries were "hidingbehind" France on the issue....A European diplomat said the issue of calling Hezbollah a terroristorganization was discussed in Brussels on Wednesday at a meeting of theClearing House, a unit of the European Union that meets in confidentialsessions to review terrorist activities in Europe. The group could reachno consensus, the diplomat said. "Nothing is going to change onHezbollah because we don't have an agreement among the member states,"the diplomat said. "That doesn't mean we won't get a consensus. I knowthe Americans are impatient, but the European Union has 25 states, andthese things take time." Some of those interviewed tried to make itsound as if the reason they are hesitant to go along with Bush isbecause of the situation in Lebanon. But as The Captain points out, itprobably has more to do with Iran:I suspect the true reason for the reluctance comes not from the"delicate" nature of Lebanese politics, but from the relationshipbetween Hezbollah and the Iranians. The EU has tried for the past twoyears to appease the Iranian mullahs into giving up theirnuclear-weapons ambitions to little avail. They don't want to rock theboat now by attempting to starve out the mullahs' terror agent thatconducts the proxy attacks against Israel that Iran cannot afford to doitself openly. They did not learn from Hitler's Germany I guess, theytried to appease that guy too.This whole thing just reminds me how corrupt and useless France is.They will forever be known as that corrupt and cowards in my opinion.Read From On High , Dhimmi Watch , Cranky Neocon , and My View Of TheWorld for more.

===========Input: Fallujah's 'Final Solution'? zeyad : The interim government declared a state of emergency in Iraqexcluding the Kurdish region for 60 days, according to the NationalSecurity Law introduced last August which states that emergency laws canbe declared in the country for a period no more than 60 days provided aserious threat against Iraqi national security is recognised by theinterim government.Obviously, this is a necessary step that should have been taken atleast two months ago. Suicide bombings and guerrilla attacks carried outby insurgents and foreign terrorists based around Baghdad have escalatedto alarming levels particularly during Ramadan.Deputy governor of Diyala along with several council members fromBa'quba were ambushed and killed in Latifiya south of Baghdad, an areawhich has supposedly been 'cleared' from insurgents a couple of weeksago. Four suicide attacks in Samarra, also a recently 'liberated' area,against National Guard units and the governorate building. Zarqawi'sgroup claimed responsibility for the attacks.Three police stations in Haditha, a small town west of Ramadi, wereassaulted by groups of insurgents. Some 30 policemen were captured, tiedup and executed in cold blood against the walls following aconfrontation which lasted two hours. Zarqawi's group, again, claimingresponsibility.A full-scale military operation against Fallujah, which is apparentlyunderway already, seems to be the government's 'final solution'. I'm notoptimistic to the outcome, especially when significant civiliancasualties are unavoidable.Note, that I'm not suggesting a peaceful or political solution wouldwork either in these areas. Insurgents west of Baghdad have quiteobstinately made it clear that nothing but full control of the country,or at least the Anbar governorate, will satisfy them. They have refusedto participate in the political process, they have repeatedly announcedtheir intentions to boycott the elections and to disrupt them in otherareas, and they do not recognise the government or any other authorityin the country beside themselves.The demands of the Fallujah negotiants from the government weeks agowere obscene and they clearly reflect the overt sectarianism andregionalism of the armed groups in the area. The demands were notreleased to the Iraqi public at the time for unkown reasons but theyhave leaked out days ago. Here are just a few of them:-A clear timetable for the withdrawal of foreign occupation forces(fair enough).-Immediate withdrawal of US and Iraqi security forces from the Anbargovernorate and the handover of security responsibilities to former armyofficers from Anbar.-The appointment of ministers from the Anbar governorate to theministries of Interior, Defense, Oil and Finance.-The removal of certain officials (most of them from Shi'ite Islamicparties such as Ibrahim Al-Ja'fari) from governmental positions.-The complete return of Ba'athists, army officers, Republican Guards,Mukhabarat, intelligence and security personnel to their formerpositions.-The removal of Shi'ite Edhan (call for prayers) from officialtelevision and radio programs.-Incomes of Shi'ite sacred shrines should be returned under thecontrol of the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs.These last two demands have been allegedly added by Sheikh HarithAl-Dhari (head of the Association of Muslim Scholars) and are said tohave been a major reason behind the failure of negotiations with thegovernment.Iraqis here in the south were shocked to hear of these demands andsectarian tensions are on the rise. It scares me to see the reaction ofpeople around me whenever Fallujah is mentioned. The director of aprimary health care clinic was remarking the other day that "Fallujahshould be burnt upon its residents and then razed to the ground. Theyare the sons of Mu'awiya, may Allah curse them all." Sidenote: Mu'awiyabin Abi Sufyan was the governor of Syria during the 7th century and hefought Imam Ali bin Abi Talib (Muhammed's son-in-law) over the Caliphateafter the assassination of Caliph Othman. He became the first UmmayidCaliph and two decades later, under the Caliphate of his son Yazid, ImamHussein bin Ali (grandson of Muhammed) was killed by his armies atpresent day Karbala. Someone hushed the director and pointed out to himthat I'm Sunni. He was a bit embarrassed and tried to explain that hewas referring to Wahhabis and foreign fighters. It was a bituncomfortable and I could feel that people were giving me furtiveglances.Refugees have been pouring out of Fallujah over the last few daysinto Baghdad and the surrounding areas. The military operation willundoubtly aggravate the humanitarian situation inside the city sincethere are definitely thousands of families with no place to go. Refugeesin Baghdad have confirmed the rumours that the 'Mujahideen' are forcingmen from 15-50 years old to stay and that they were threatened withexecution if they refuse to carry arms in defense of the town. MajlisShura Al-Mujahideen (The Mujahideen Advisory Council) are in control ofFallujah and they have distributed a statement inviting Arab and foreign(including American) media reporters to enter the town and cover thebattles. The statement carried the insignia of Zarqawi's group Qa'idatAl-Jihad .Everyone is closely watching what the next few days will bring,hoping the violence doesn't spread to the streets of Baghdad or otherareas. I'm still holed up in Basrah but I'll try to be on the road assoon as possible.

===========Input: Daylight Savings Time is retarded Mark Backer : I am 36 years old. I've been around a while. I'm not 87 or anything,but I've seen some things in my life. I have initially agreed anddisagreed with different things over the years, only to have my mindchanged later. However, I will never EVER change my mind about theidiocy we call Daylight Savings Time.I Googled "Daylight Savings Time" and I got the following link:http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/I started reading...The site says things like "We've learned to save energy and enjoysunny summer evenings by switching our clocks an hour forward in thesummer" and there's no S at the end of Savings. It should be DaylightSaving Time.My apologies to the assclowns that invented this idiocy and thegoobers that perpetuate it in such a ridiculous fashion.I will concede that "springing forward" and "falling back" are goodways to remember to change the batteries in your smoke detectors.However, New Years and the Fourth of July would do the same thing.I kept reading the website of propoganda and found that the firstperson to come up with the idea was Benjamin Franklin who did it onbehalf of some friends that owned oil companies (oil was used in lamps).I assume that, because the idea was dumb and inconvenient, lots ofpeople ignored it. "By 1966, some 100 million Americans were observingDST based on their own local laws and customs. Congress decided to stepin to end the confusion and establish one pattern across the country.The Uniform Time Act of 1966 (15 U.S. Code Section 260a) which wassigned into Public Law 89-387 on 12 April 1966, by President LyndonJohnson, created Daylight Saving Tim to begin on the last Sunday ofApril and to end on the last Sunday of October. Any State that wanted tobe exempt from DST could do so by passing a state law.There's a LOT more to this since then, and you can read a lot more itif you want to, but this is what I know:Indiana's eastern half doesn't use it. What's THAT all about?Arizona doesn't use it because one tribe of Indians stretches intothree states. But those other states DO use it.Hawaii doesn't use it at all. Of course, they're closer to Japan thanto us, and since Japan doesn't use it, Hawaii just plays along. (Do youthink the Hawaiian's sit around, staring west, just becuase they stilldon't trust the Japs?)Regardless of when I go to bed (11pm or 10pm or 9pm), I get up at5:30 and I am fucking exhausted. How can that be? I slept the samenumber of hours as I did two weeks ago, yet I'm tired?Also, I am so hungry I could eat my little tub of Carmex by 10:30amevery day. I used to eat lunch between 11:30 and noon, but now, eatingis all I think about after 10am. Why is that good for me?I don't care if America saves 1% of its energy consumption costsduring those times. I am tired, hungry, and I leave for work and gethome from work in the dark. How healthy is that?For that matter, I don't care about any of the pro-farming oranti-crime propoganda. Daylight SAVINGS Time sucks!!Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go stalk the lobby for the girlsthat are bringing me my Krystals. order and fight to keep myself fromfalling asleep in my cube. Amy : About time you realized Daylight SavingS time is the work of Satan'sminions. Jassalasca Jape : You would feel comfortable in China, then; it's the same timeeverywhere.

After all the smacktalk that's gone on for the last 360 days, and all of the games thatboth teams have played and the hopes each had for the 2004 season, it'scome down to this.To stay undefeated and alive for a chance at the BCS title game,Auburn must win this Saturday in it's 3:30 EST game on CBS against theGeorgia Bulldogs.If they hope to move up from their current number five ranking andkeep the hope alive of playing in the SEC Title Game in December,Georgia must beat Auburn.This game is as good as it gets. Sure, Auburn's in-state rival isAlabama, but year in and year out, this game, the Auburn-UGA game, seemslike the one that matters more. I seldom if ever root for Bama, but Ialways root for UGA to be undefeated when the play Auburn. The game isbig enough already, but it seems even bigger when one or both teams havesomething on the line.Yes, both teams have other games left to play and yes, other teams'results may affect what happens to both of these teams, but in just fivedays, these two teams will play the biggest and most important game oftheir season.So now it's time for all of the yapping and jawing and talking shitthat goes with this game.Except I don't do that. I can't do that. Anytime I try to talk shit,I get all nauseous and worry about what happens not if but WHEN we lose.I don't know if it's just me or if being this pragmatic is what it meansto be an Auburn fan. I wonder if deep down THIS is what it feels like tobe a Red Sox fan: regardless of where you are or what is happening toyour team, deep down you don't just think, you KNOW something bad isgoing to happen.Anyway, I am flying my flag on my house with pride and I am lookingforward to the game that, year in and year out, gives us the besthitting and mos entertaining football played on the highest level. It'sSEC football at it's core.War Eagle. Anonymous : balls

===========Input: Blurble... Mark Backer : It's now just one day until I hop in the car and head back in time tothe loveliest village on the Plains...Auburn, Alabama.I haven't been back since 1994 and when I was talking to my wifeabout the trip this morning, it seems like a lifetime ago. Hell, it'sbeen half my life since I was in school there and over two thirds of myadult life, assuming that people that know me think my adult life hasactually started yet.Anyway, enough nostalgia from me, at least for now.The wife and I were watching SportsCenter this morning, and LeeCorso, Mark May and Trev Alberts were ALL picking Auburn to beatGeorgia, and the last two were picking them to run the table for theright to play USC for the national championship.Blurble....Then, I open the Atlanta paper this morning, and EVERYTHING ispro-UGA. I mean, I knew it would be, but some of it was even based onfacts.Like this beauty: When Auburn and their opponent are both in the topten, Auburn is 4-6-1 in those games. Auburn has lost the last threegames that fit that scenario.Blurble....Auburn's last defeat came at the hands of...UGA.Blurble...Auburn does lead the overall record in the series 51-46-8. However,the road team's record in this series. AT Auburn, UGA is 11-8-2. AtAthens, Auburn is 17-8. This trend was serious in the 80's, with theroad team winning about two-thirds of the time. The only time thischanged recently really was when UGA decided to win in their place in2003. Thanks Dawgs.Blurble...On the upside, Auburn has scored at least 33 points in the last sixgames. That's a pretty nice run.Auburn leads the SEC in scoring offense, scoring defense and rushingdefense.Auburn is second in the nation in scoring defense and seventh in passdefense.Jason Campbell is 3rd in the nation in passing efficiency while DavidGreene is 10th.Here are a couple of middle of the road stats:Auburn's Quentin Groves and Georgia's David Pollack are tied for theSEC sack lead.Here's the biggest for what it's worth stat as far as I am concerned:both teams are undefeated this year when scoring first. Auburn is 8-0and UGA is 5-0. I'd say that's the biggest stat right now.Auburn's offense is potent and efficient. UGA's defense is relentlessand contains a couple of the country's biggest hitters, especially GregBlue and Odell Thurman.Auburn's defense is fast and relentless and the DB's are experiencedand big. UGA's receivers are leaders, with one of them a team captain.Auburn's two running backs are seniors and very experienced anddangerous, bruising backs. UGA's two backs are smaller freshmen withless experience, but are dangerous as well.In my mind, the game is going to turn on a few key points, someobvious and some not. Here goes the prediction machine:- Turnovers (as always) will be critical.- Special teams play and lack of special teams mistakes will tell thetale regarding field position.- Both teams MUST establish the run to be successful. If Auburn goesfor 150 between their two backs, they're almost impossible to beat.Conversely, Georgia MUST be able to run the ball to set up play actionand keep the pressure off of David Greene.- Mark Richt has proven to be a better on the fly adjustment coachthat Tommy Tuberville. Tubs is famous for taking chances, oftenunnecessary ones. That history is of concern to me. While it's okay totry crazy shit when your team is under-rated or a serious underdog, it'simportant not to give games away when you're the favorite. Playing more"by the book" and a bit "closer to the vest" becomes the call for theday.Considering all of these factors, I truly believe that this isAuburn's year. They may not go undefeated and they may not get into theBCS title game, but they have enough talent, poise and experience to winthis game.Auburn wins 31-21.And now that I have typed that prediction, I may just throw up in mymouth.War...Blurble...Eagle!!Added at 1:28pm on 11/12/04Ack!!David Greene is the winningest QB in NCAA division I history!! ANDhe's 15-1 on the road!!15-1 on the road???UGA wins 24-21Blurble.

===========Input: Putting the cart before the horse... Mark Backer : You know, for the past five days and really for about the pastfifteen or twenty days, I've been angry about the BCS rankings and whyAuburn isn't ranked higher and all of that business. Can someone tell mewhy one of my friends or family members hasn't smacked me because of it?I mean, here we are, 10-0 and staring down the barrell of a road gameAT Tuscaloosa against our hated rivals, the Alabama Crimson Tide, andI'm bitching about how we better get to play for a national title?Really?You don't have to think back too far to find a similar scenario, onlywith the shoe firmly on the other foot.In 1989, Alabama was 10-0, number two in the nation and coming intoAuburn for the first time ever to play at Jordan-Hare Stadium. All thetalk for the weeks leading up to the game was about "if Bama'sundefeated, they'll play for it all in the Sugar Bowl" and other craplike that.Well, "if or when" never happened because Auburn won 30-20 in one ofthe greatest Iron Bowl games ever, putting an end to Bama's nationaltitle hopes for the year.15 years later, the situation's reversed. It's Auburn that'sundefeated and facing the road game at the end of the season.Suddenly, I'm about nauseous about this game too. Despite beingriddled with injuries, Alabama has a ridiculously stout defense,recently ranked as the number one defense in the country.Egad. Has all of the bluster and talking shown up on The Plains aswell? I only hope that Coach Tuberville has been successful at keepinghis players focused, motivated and thinking about ONLY the Alabama game.

You never EVER show up at court, especiallyfacing indictment for stealing large sums of money, wearing a fuckingFUR COAT!! Fake or not, you look like you're rubbing the common man'snose in it.Schrenko is a scumbag and, although she won't get any actual jailtime, I hope the fine she pleads to is at least as much as what shestole. Otherwise, she's learned nothing.Remember when Michael Milken got busted, he was not forced to give uphis secret accounts, and when the fine of 600 million was levied...HEPAID IT!! Hell, at his zenith, that's what he made in ONE YEAR!!"Um...how much, your honor? 600 large? Yeah, lemme just get mycheckbook out of my diamond encrusted briefcase."Schrenko stole 20 times what Martha Stewart did, and I bet she won'tsee the wrong side of a jail cell door, and that's sad. Because it'speople like Schrenko for which jails were specifically designed...

===========Input: 1 day to glory... Mark Backer : Well, it's mid-morning on the East coast and I am sitting hererunning numbers thru my head trying to figure out what's going to happenin the Iron Bowl, which is just over 29 hours away.The game is being played in Tuscaloosa, which should be an advantageto Alabama. However, In the two times the game has been played in BryantDenny Stadium, Auburn has won.Alabama has one of the stingiest defenses in the country, and wereranked number one in overall defense as recently as last week.Conversely, Auburn has one of the most potent and balanced offensiveattacks in the nation. Also, I don't think Bama has faced an attack withtwo great runners, a great line, a poised QB and good receivers and atight end as well.Bama is missing it's starting offensive backfield from the start ofthe season. The fact that they've won six games is a testament to thecoaching and heart of the players.Alabama simply cannot throw the football, which is a good thing,because Auburn's defensive backfield is second to none. Bama can run theball however. Unfortunately for them, with no passing game to keep thedefense honest, Auburn will probably stack nine in the box, play man onthe corners, and dare Bama to run, and I don't think they'll be able todo it.Auburn is also 9-0 when they score first. The Tuberville way is toget one quick and early to get your crowd into it if you're at home andto quiet the other team's crowd if you're on the road.You can never tell what is going to happen in rivalry games. In thisexact game 15 years ago, Bama came into Auburn #2 in the country,undefeated at 10-0 and looking for yet another national championship.They were summarily trounced 30-20 in a game in which the score wascloser than the actual game. That could very well happen Saturday.I always tell people that the Georgia game matters more to me thanthe Bama game. I live in Georgia, and losing that game affects me muchmore directly than losing the Alabama game. That said, when kickoff timecomes, you remember all the reasons that you hate Alabama and theirdumbass haircuts and their detergent and toilet paper and theirhoundstooth hats and their "Bear this" and "Bear that," and everythingelse that goes along with it. This isn't a football game, and it's nottwo drunken cousins fighting at a family reunion. This is brotheragainst brother after one slept with the other's wife and then braggedabout it. It's THAT serious.However, when it's all said and done, I just don't think Alabama hasthe horses to stand up to what I believe is going to be enormousdefensive pressure. If Auburn takes care of the ball and executes, thisgame shouldn't be as close as some think.My call:Auburn 37Alabama 13Now pass the Tums. I don't feel so well...War Eagle!!

===========Input: There's not "holiday" in this Holiday weekend... Mark Backer : We have been on the go since about noon on Wednesday and even longerin the wife's case. She started cleaning about a week before the holidayand cleaned for about two weeks right thru the holiday.We spent Friday doing a little shopping and got to bed early, butSaturday was busy with football watching. The Irish suck. Not as apeople, but as a football team. The looked good for 15 minutes, but thenthey got run over by Matt Leinert and USC. I have no beef with USC beingnumber one, but Oklahoma is nowhere close to number two in the country,and I am sick of the pollsters who only look at East coast scoresinstead of watching tape of the games. Auburn has trailed in exactly twogames this year, and has given up less than 9.5 points per game.Oklahoma has given up bucketloads of points, but still gets some mysteryrespect for it.(I know many of you may be tired of my rants about this, have nofear. It'll all be over by next Sunday night or Monday morning. At thatpoint, we're either in or fucked and either way, I'm writing about itonce then, and that will be it).Anyway, we decided to go ahead and get a fake tree yesterday, and wegot that bad boy put up yesterday and are decorating it today. We alsogot all of our exterior lights up today, marking the first time thisfamily has ever had their decorating done by Thanksgiving Sunday. Bigkudos to the missus.It feels weird not watching racing today, but it'll get easier andthen, come January 10th or so, there'll be testing news and driversigning news and we'll be on the back side of the remaining 84 daysuntil the Daytona 500.Until tomorrow kids, WAR EAGLE!!

===========Input: Somebody alert the media!!! Mark Backer : Apparently Jason Giambi, recently the non-playing and "sick" firstbaseman of the New York Yankees, admitted to a Grand Jury that he"injected anabolic steroids and human growth hormone (HGH) as recentlyas 2003. And he apparently got them thru BALCO and (surprise) the sameguy that is Barry Bonds' trainer, once Greg Anderson.Since that Grand Jury testimony was given, Giambi repeatedly deniedusing any steroids, HGH, or anything else to anyone and everyone thatwould listen.Jason's brother Jeremy also admitted to the grand jury that he usedsteroids.Now, Barry is denying he's done any steroids and Gary Sheffield'sdenying he's done any steroids, but one by one, the lesser (and bigger)players in this deal are seeing their testimony coming into the thepublic eye where they admitted that they DID do steroids. It seems thatanyone associated with this special "trainer" Greg Anderson is coming updirty.It's a good thing that Major League Baseball has such a tough steroidpolicy, or this story may not have been brought to our attention.(cough...cough...sarcasm...cough).Never mind if the steroids and human growth hormones were illegal inbaseball or not. They are illegal to use in the United States. I want toknow where the Federal criminal charges against all parties involvedare. Anyone?The fact that these guys (Sheff, the Giambis, Marion Jones, Bonds andmany others) are running around denying this shit and acting like PeteRose did any time someone asked him about gambling (getting uberdefensive, denying it implicitly and acting like the person asking hadpersonally assaulted him) is appalling. These clowns are messing withpeople's careers by insisting they're being lied about, yet when itturns out the reporters weren't lying and the athletes were, nothing isdone.I have never denied that Barry Bonds was a special and giftedathlete. Whether it's steroids, HGH, crank, lighter fluid or antifreezehe's using, being able to perform at this level for this length of timedefies logic or reason. That's why it's a shame that, in the finalanalysis, all of Bonds' numbers and accomplishments are going to beignored and lumped into the statement "yeah, but he was on steroids."It's a pity he and the others are too dumb to see that.And now, just so you don't think that every entry in this blog willbe like the one above, here's a great joke I read today:A man takes his Rottweiler to the vet and says, "My dog's cross-eyed,is there anything you can do for him? ""Well," says the vet, "let's have a look at him."So he picks the dog up and examines his eyes, then checks his teeth.Finally, the vet says "I'm going to have to put him down.""What? Because he's cross-eyed?""No, because he's really heavy."I will be breaking down the SEC championship game either later todayor tomorrow, so I expect you all to be planted firmly on the edge ofyour seats waiting for that one.War Eagle everybody!

===========Input: Hey, look who got screwed... Mark Backer : I am having a difficult time putting my feelings into words rightnow, so bear with me.First of all, I want to congratulate the Auburn Football team fordoing what no other Auburn football team has done; going 12-0. They alsowon their first outright SEC title since 1987 and won their first SECtitle since the conference implimented the Championship game format.A year ago, the program was in disarray and the coach was one poorlyexecuted plane trip away from being fired by an over-zealous and tooempowered booster with a fat checkbook. Since that day, the team isundefeated and has won 14 games in a row. They have now beated fourteams that were in the top 15 at the time the games were played, and twoof those games were won away from Jordan-Hare Stadium.On championship weekend, the big three all played. USC won by fiveover a shitty UCLA team with a 6-5 record, and that was thanks in partto an official who blew dead a clear and obvious fumble that would havebeen returned for a UCLA touchdown.Oklahoma played in it's conference title game against a four-lossColorado team that can't throw the ball. The result was a 40 plus pointbeatdown, but what did anyone expect?Auburn played 15th ranked Tennessee and was attempting to do one ofthe toughest things to do in college football: beating a team twice inthe same year.With the exception of a 15 yard shanked punt and a punt snap thatKody Bliss missed while having an apparent thrombosis, Auburn led 21-7at the half and had held UT to 46 yards of offense. While the Auburnrunning game was held up, Jason Campbell threw it all over the ballfield and, when his receivers were covered, he ran for yardage on hisown. This despite several late hits to the head, low hits at his kneesand ankles, and various other assaults outside the realm of goodsportsmanship.Tennessee scored on a pass play that was incorrectly ruled atouchdown, since the ball clearly touched the turf, and that's where themomentum of the game changed. I think it was also at that point that thescoreboard began to reflect Auburn's last title hopes dying as theOklahoma-Colorado score would have begun showing the beat-down that wasoccuring.Auburn was tied 21-21 and in jeapordy of losing it most importantgame ever, but senior QB Jason Campbell would have none of it.Auburn won going away 38-28, and the only place the game looked closewas on the scoreboard.I can't believe that an undefeated SEC team is not playing for atitle, but I guess we can thank Jeff Sagarin and the other dicks thatkeep voting USC number one to make up for what happened to them lastyear. All I know is that they better think that way next year, becauseit's Auburn that got screwed this year.And what's better is that Auburn gets to play one of the threehottest teams in the country in my opinion. Virginia Tech is talented,very athletic and one of the most well coached teams in the country andthey WILL come to play on January 3rd.I hope our kids can shake off this travesty and focus on making thepollsters look like idiots. Maybe an Oklahoma win in a butt-ugly gameand a great Auburn performance could help.What's the definition of pragmatic? Going undefeated and chanting"We're number TWO!!"War Eagle

===========Input: So get this... Mark Backer : I'm reading ESPN this morning when I stumbled across the story whereKobe Bryant said he'd like to sit down with Shaq and apologize to himfor "involving him in my troubles." Bryant also says that he thinksDecember 25th "sounds like a good day to me to kind of talk to him andtell him I never meant in any kind of way to bring any of his personalbusiness out."You see, after Kobe's world fell apart because he couldn't resistbanging the crazy white towel clerk at his hotel, he needed an out. Hebought his wife a four million dollar ring and got some tattoos thatsaid how much he loved her, but he needed to do more to attractattention away from himself.So he told the media that he should have done what Shaq always did,just pay the women to shut up. Kobe also alleged that O'neal had paidupwards of one million dollars in this way as hush money over the years.Shaq has denied it from the beginning, but that's not really thepoint.It's no secret that a large number of the NBA's "stars" are notexactly star-worthy. Good players or not, guys like Kemp and Bryant andIverson and the entire Blazers team are just not very nice or goodpeople. If the league will tolerate it, what do I care?But the real issue is this. Kobe's Lakers will play Shaq's Miami Heaton...that's right...December 25th.So the real motivation for Kobe here is not to mend fences or admithe was wrong to involve any other person in his own little pit of woe.It is to find some sort of way to keep the 340-pound Shaquille and histeammates from beating the ever-loving shit out of Kobe for 48pain-filled minutes on Christmas Day.I can't tell you the number of ways that Kobe Bryant makes me sick.Despite his slick talk and his nice diction, he's nothing but a cheaterand a liar and a punk. I hardly watch any NBA games because the leagueand most of it's players sicken me, but I've had December 25th circledon my calendar since the day after Shaq signed with the Heat.That's the day that Shaq will take a million dollars or more out ofKobe's punk-ass.

===========Input: It ain't much... Mark Backer : Sorry I haven't been posting much lately. We have been so damned busywith the holidays (that's what we call December at our house) that Ijust haven't had time.I read a funny joke today and I thought I'd share it with you. One ofmy fellow eggers posted it, so Chet, here's your credit:A traveler was driving through Arkansas when he lost his way and gotoff the main highway. As he drove by, he saw rows and rows of pigstiesand pigpens and pigs running in fields and pigs wallowing in mud.Suddenly, his eye caught something really strange. He did a double take,muttered to himself and then looked a third time. He wondered if he hadseen correctly - it looked like a pig with a wooden leg! He found thelane to the farm and drove up into the farmyard, where he was met by thefarmer. "Excuse me," the traveler said. "I was just driving by andlooking at all your pigs, and I noticed something that I just had tostop and ask about. Tell me, did I see right? Is there really a pig outthere with a wooden leg?" The farmer smiled. "Oh, that would be oldCaesar you saw. He's the finest pig a man could ever hope to have - andsmart! Well, let me tell you a little about that pig. You see that bargedown there on the river? That's a mining dredge, taking out platinumore. Old Caesar sniffed out the vein and showed us how to set it up. Nowthat dredge brings me in about $120,000 every year. "There's anotherthing, too, a little more personal. One night a couple of years ago Igot to drinking and I guess I had more than I should have. I passed outdrunk, fell down and knocked over a lamp. That started a fire in thehouse and old Caesar smelled the smoke. He came in the back door, gotthe wife and kid out, roused me up and got me out. "There is no questionabout it - that night old Caesar saved all our lives and you know thatis not the sort of thing a man is going to forget too easily." "Why,"the traveler said, "this is all amazing! I have never heard of a piglike this before! This is fantastic! But tell me, how did he get thatwooden leg? Was he in a wreck or something?" The farmer laughed andsaid, "Well, naturally, when you have a pig that smart, you don't wantto eat him all at one time!"

===========Input: Did anyone see the Packers game Sunday? Mark Backer : While it was entertaining, that's not why I'm posting about it. Idon't normally post about pro football, but what I saw deserved aranting or two, and I suspect it's going to get many more in the daysand weeks to come.With 4:41 left in the fourth quarter and the Packers down by 11,Favre hit Robert Ferguson with a 31 yard strike near the left hashmarks. Coming from the other direction, Jacksonville DB Donovin Dariusunloaded chin high on Ferguson with a vicious clothesline. Remarkably,Ferguson held on to the ball, despite being disjoined from his helmet onthe hit. After many minutes lying motionless on the field, Ferguson wasfinally removed via stretcher, giving a thumbs up to the crowd on theway out.The Packers went on to lose the game, but that's not the story here.This was not one of the staged stiff-armed clotheslines you see inprofessional wrestling broadcasts. This was a vicious, arm cocked andswinging clothesline that literally could have torn Ferguson's head offof his body.The play was immediately flagged, and moments later it was announcedthat Darius had been ejected, much to the crowd's delight.One sidenote here is that, despite their rabid fandom and thesituation, not one thing was thrown at the offending player as he leftthe field. It would have been easy to bathe him in beer or snowballs orbatteries as he left, but the Packer fans are classier than that. To aperson, they acted with class, using their voices and not projectiles toexpress their displeasure.This was the most vicious and blatantly dirty play I have seen in theNFL since Jim McMahon was body slammed to the ground in the mid 80'sabout five seconds after he had released a pass. And Jaguars coach JackDel Rio and Darius had the nerve to vociferously argue with officialsabout Darius' ejection from the game.I don't care what anyone says about "you can't judge intent." Darius'intent was to dismember, injure or even kill Ferguson. The more I sawthe replay, the sicker it made me feel.The league must take action, and it must be swift and sure. I'mtalking about a four game suspension that included the playoffs ifnecessary.In this day and age of bigger, stronger and faster players, injuriesare going to happen accidentally all of the time. There is simply noroom for the kind of play that resulted in Ferguson's injury. PaulTagliabue must give word to all of his employees that actions like thiswill not be tolerated.Maybe that will tell the Jaguars, Darius and players like him thatthis kind of head-hunting will not be tolerated in the NFL.If not, I fully expect the Packers and many other teams to handlethis matter "on the field" with Darius being the target of similarattacks by tight ends and offensive lineman.

===========Input: We're Number 2!!!! Mark Backer : The college football season is finally over. On one hand, I am a bitsad because years like this only happen for Auburn every 15 or 20 years,so it's a little disappointing.On the other hand, this worked out about as well as it could. If youasked me at the beginning of the year if I'd rather be 8-3 and playingin the liberty bowl or 12-0 with a chance to win the Sugar Bowl, go 13-0and finish second, I'd say hell yeah to the latter.The fact that pundits put OU ahead of Auburn based on their out ofconference schedule being tougher than ours is laughable now. In theend, playing Bowling Green over us playing The Citadel didn't make theSooners much better. Man, I've seen softer takedowns on Cops. USC cameon to the field, gave up a TD, then decided to make Choke-lahoma theircollective bitches, and they did just that.38-10 at the half meant that I didn't even have to hear that dyinghyena Ashlee "no, I'm the one with dark hair and no boobs" Simpsonbutcher yet another song on tv. Hell, I read it on Fark this morning.Hooray for big first half beatings that get me an extra hour of sleep.We might not have won, but we wouldn't have let Leinert go long on usall night either. Our db's would have had something to say about that.And, it turns out that when playing a decent team, OU can't do shit onoffense. That was just plain terrible. Jason White looked like JasonVoorhees out there, stomping around getting caught from every directionany time he didn't hand of to Peterson for a three yard loss.In five years, Oklahoma has played in four huge games, and lost threeof them...badly. That must feel like being a Sox fan before this year,I'd imagine.Anyway, I feel great. Think about this. A year ago, Tuberville wasone reporter's abililty to find an out of place airplane in Ohio awayfrom being fired BEFORE the Alabama game. Then, the AD and President getcanned, a booster starts down the long road to shun-ville, andTuberville keeps smiling and saying the right things.He talks his two running backs and two stellar DB's into staying,then knocks out 15 straight wins and signs one of those super iron-cladcontracts that will pay him 14 million over seven years, and if Auburneven thinks...THINKS about letting him go, they owe him every penny. Idon't even think there's a morality clause. He could have sex with anendangered Bald Eagle, and they'd STILL have to pay him. And that's theway it should be.Meanwhile, Auburn fans can spend the next six months saying "yeah,but we'd have done this" or "We were 13-0, won the sec, beat five topten teams, three of them on the road, and became the only undefeated SECteam in the BCS's history to NOT play for the title." Andcoincidentally, Oklahoma's played in it this year, last year, and in2000. You won in 2000, but you got punked the last two years, and lastyear you got to play for the title even though you didn't even win yourconference. You got embarassed by Kansas State and LSU last year, andhumiliated this year. But the little 12 is SOOO much better than theSEC. That's why you played a four-loss team for your conference titlethis year. And, considering the BCS is run by the head of the Big 12,it's no wonder you get the benefit of the doubt.Don't think so? How about the fact that only two teams that didn'twin their conference have ever played for the national title? You andNebraska in 2001. Oh, the other thing you two Big 12 teams have incommon is that you got your asses kicked on the sport's biggest stage.So yes, we are disappointed. But all you can do is play the schedulein front of you. Auburn did that with class and dignity, they won everygame, faced down every challenge, and made every Auburn fan in thecountry and the world proud.War Eagle!!Now, can someone get the Auburn cheerleaders some of those USCsweaters?

===========Input: Who saw this coming? Mark Backer : Much like the "I told you so's" everyone is throwing at the UGAbasketball program after their hiring and subsequent firing of TheHarricks, folks around the Buckeye state have to be having similarthoughts.It seems that AD and frequent "No we didn't" Ohio State front manAndy Geiger is "retiring" after 11 years at the helm.Maybe it's me, but I'm guessing Andy's tired of putting on TV makeupand going on the news lying about what he or Tressel knew about theirathletes in general and their football program in particular. It seemsthat Maurice Clarrett-gate just isn't going away.Two years ago, everyone was saying "shame on you, Maurice. You shouldhave known better." Now, it seems like most folks are saying "Shame onyou both Andy and Jim. YOU both should have know better."Allegations have come to light that several OSU players receivedillegal benefits including cash, access to cars, etc. Now, I don'texpect the AD and coach to know everything, but when a player is drivinga brand new car every couple of weeks or months, well, somebody ought tojot a memo and get to the bottom of that.It shouldn't surprise Buckeye fans either, since Tressel had similarproblems at Youngstown State, and left a wake of controversy behindhimself there as well, including (surprise) illegal benefits includingcash, cars, grade fixing, etc.Geiger is also tired from saying "we didn't do anything wrong" abouthis basketball program. Of course, it was discovered that his men'sbasketball coach had directly given six grand to a Yugoslavian recruit,but that was just his stipend for travel and coach Jim O'Brien was justhaving a problem with the currency exchange rates...right Andy?I only hope that the NCAA will do something they rarely do: make agood sound decision and take away Ohio State's national title fromJanuary 2003. It seems they had a very important and very ineligibleplayer that season, and maybe many.

===========Input: If a tree fell in a Cadadian forest... Mark Backer : would it make a noise and if it did, would anyone south of Bostongive a shit?Wednesday, Commissioner Gary Bettman announced the cancellation ofthe 2004-2005 NHL season. As if everyone didn't already know that wasthe case.Shame on the NHL and shame on the players' association for notgetting a deal done, but I put much more of the blame on the owners asthis "negotiation" came down to the wire.I understand that the league was losing less money by not playingthan it would have by having a season this year. I also understand thatwhen push came to shove, the players gave in and accepted a salary cap.Okay, the sides were about 7 million per team apart, but couldn't theyjust say "alright, let's split that in half and play hockey?"I mean Holy Christ people, two kids arguing over 10 bucks would workit out that way. Why is this any different? The NHL's primary goal wasto get a salary cap approved by the players, and they finally did. Andwhat did the NHL do when that momentus event occurred?They left the negotiating table.Gary Bettman is a mindless troll and the professional sportscommissioner equivalent of Joe Hazelwood and this lockout / strike /cluster fuck is the reef.The first thing that needs to happen is that Bettman and Goodenow(the players' association rep) need to be fired, deported, flogged,tarred and feathered and finally forced to pay for four tickets plus aprogram, four dogs, four beers, and two cokes and parking to a game atan NHL arena for every day of the next season so they understand whatthe fans go thru to see a hockey game.Then, all current contracts need to be voided by the end of theseason in 2006. That means no team would own any player, and the ownerswould be free to sign whomever they'd like using the "fiscal restraint"they all droned on and on about all year. That way, they'd only pay asmuch as they could afford...right?Wrong.Those douchebags would end up overspending like every professionalsports owner because they can't control themselves. If Mr. Iginla orHeatley were free agents, for example, owners would bid each other outof their minds, then they'd be left with not enough to get a competetiveteam.While the business model in the NHL was certainly flawed and theowners needed help, they really needed help to protect them fromthemselves. And the fact is that without that help, the owners wouldfollow the same path that got them where they are right now anyway.The biggest issue is this, however. Very few people give one hot shitwhether the NHL plays another game ever, let alone this season or thenext one. For every crying Canuck there are 1,000 or more others who say"No hockey? Huh...didn't even notice."And the last television network interested in carrying hockey (ESPN)may opt out of televising the NHL next season, meaning that all of theteams would be in HUGE trouble, because no TV = no league. Period.Atlanta lost the Flames 25 years ago because, despite full houses everynight, it's TV revenue that pays the freight and the Flames had no tvcontract. Imagine an entire league with no TV contract. Hell, MajorLeague Soccer and the WNBA DO have a tv contract and no one gives a shitabout them.I'll say this for the NHL, when they screw up, they screw up huge.Congrats guys. You will forever be known as the generation thatkilled professional hockey in North America. That'll look GREAT on yourresumes.

===========Input: Martha Stewart: Last Day of the "Living" Dead Byrne : Shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia , a company whose name isso breathtakingly self-promoting it makes me long for the days whenevery single entity involve in real estate or casinos was called Trump,continues to soar; it rose $1.78, or 7.29%, on news that the company'snamesake will star in a new TV show once she, er... gets out of prison.Now, I know there have been succesful companies that dealt with crooks(Warner Communications, which started as a merger between business inthe three most mob-influenced industries around, comes to mind), butit's a gamble and not a business strategy.The company's performance wasn't all that hot even before the CEOwent to prison, and until very recently the stock price reflected that.But this is a one-person company, and at this point it's saying the'Martha' brand is worth some $1.31 billion. If anything, the value ofthe brand should decline over time, inasmuch as she's rather, well,mortal. And she's been convincted of obstruction of justice. This runupis based on the inexplicable hope that now that the head of the firm andthe embodiment of a much-resented brand is no longer doing time forlying to the Federal government, they'll be able to really coin somemoney. I just don't know what to say. muckdog : Martha should do a reality show. Take 10 contestants, and give them asituation: You have company coming over for dinner; You're hosting anopen house; or, You're hosting a wedding reception. Then, she just ranksthem and eliminates one every week. The stock would really go to themoon on that press release.

===========Input: Video Rentals: The Three Hypotheses Byrne : Scrappy underdog Netflix had its day earlier in the year, when itbecame one of the hottest stocks around (sporting an eye-popping P/E inthe high 900's on the way up, and, thanks to a poor earnings report,over 1,000 on the way down). There's plenty of argument about the futureof DVD and video rental, and Netflix represents a pure-play on one ofthe three dominant hypotheses:I. That business is O-V-E-R -- Between pay-per-view, video-on-demand,pirated movies, high-bandwidth Internet broadcasts, and the increasingavailability of other media, it takes some faith to see any future formovie rentals. Those who don't have the requisite faith will point tothese factors as proof that the business is dying and the movie businessin general will need a pretty significant overhaul before it can makeprofits. Movie rentals are no longer a cheap alternative to other waysof viewing films; they're the stodgy, expensive way. There aren't anypure-play buys on this theory, but someone who believes it mightoverweight their portfolio in cable companies -- if they purchased anymedia stocks at all. Of course, there have been companies whoseperformance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea, butPsuedo.com failed without producing a single show, and Broadcast.com wasswallowed for $6 billion by Yahoo!, to Yahoo!'s great regret.II. Not so fast -- it'll just go online! -- Anyone who wants tocounter that argument would probably start by taking us back to 1997,when in terms of time used, text was the most popular kind ofinformation online. At the time, and for years after, people argued thatthe traditional bookstore would become obsolete. After all, how could westand for a rapaciously arborcidal medium like 'books' or 'newspapers'when we could transmit the same data as bits and bytes and save ontransportation, too? As it turns out, of course, Amazon.com,BarnseandNoble.com, and a host of others simply took the bookstoremodel, attached a 56K modem, and declared themselves The Future. Netflixis doing much the same thing: Taking the traditional business online tocut costs and boost customer service.III. Who d'you think you're kidding? You can't kill movie rentalstores -- So there's a big difference between movies and books: Forbooks, the retail store is practically the sole medium of distribution;if you don't sell through them, books won't get sold. For movies, thevideo rental store is just one way to get videos out there (though at45-55% of studio revenues, it's a much more important one than peoplethink). But given the high valuations ascribed tobricks-and-mortar-and-dead tree booksellers like Barnes and Noble ,Borders , and to a much lesser extent Books-A-Million , surely there'sroom for a Blockbuster , along with a Movie Gallery or two. The latter,at least, still has room to grow. By focusing on smaller, ruralcommunities (preferably the sort that considers DSL 'newfangled')they're WalMarting WalMart -- competing with Walmart's awful in-storevideo rentals by offering better selection and much lower prices.The movie business is changing dramatically as the potential foronline distribution grows, but like every other business it leaves lotsof room for traditional operators to operate at traditional (read: high)profits. The aggressive bidding war for Hollywood Video , featuring twoof their competitors, a buyout shop, and one of the savviest raidersaround, is proof that some people still think these stores are worthsomething. And I'm one of them.Full Disclosure: For once, I'm actually writing about something Iown: I have shares of Movie Gallery, I've suggested it to friends, andI'd be quite thrilled if the stock went up. I don't do 'sell targets',but I'd probably hold the stock if it ran up anything less than 50% fromthis level. If I sell, I'll post a notification one trading daybeforehand. Because Lord knows you care.

===========Input: WalMart: Conglomerating? Byrne : Conglomerates are a fascinating species: The standard definition is'a company involved in multiple unrelated businesses' but the moreaccurate definition would be 'a company that relies on financialpyrotechnics, balance sheet juggling, and adroit accounting to createthe illusion of growth'. I love to write about them, but I'd hate to ownone, since most of their market value comes from the market's assumptionthat the company's leaders will somehow find a way to retroactivelyjustify their overvaluation. Usually, it doesn't work, but when it doesthe results can be spectacularly entertaining. For a while (seeLing-Temco-Vought or Tyco for details).The recent rumors about WalMart's plans to buy out a shipping companyhave given rise to the fear that the company may go the conglomerateroute. They have many of the symptoms of a late-stage conglomerate: Agigantic main business with slowing growth, fear that competition willsubstantially reduce the profitability of their main business, ashareholder base that includes many people who own only WalMart stock(thus providing another incentive for intracompany diversification), andenough resources to pull it off on a grand scale.I can understand the concerns, but I don't see the motivation. As aretailer of just about everything, WalMart can expand into some prettybroadly-defined areas without going beyond either their corecompetencies or some arenas where they can cut costs. After all, addingsome international shipping assets to their holdings would be a naturalextension of their enormously successful practice of buying thedistribution network for their products. They're coming close toSmithfield Food's very successful 'squeal to meal' policy; if theserumors are true, the result for shareholders will be a pretty positiveone.

===========Input: They're Kidding, Right? Byrne : So Oracle and Peoplesoft , who spent the last 18 months insulting oneanother in every imaginable way, are finally tying the knot ? The finalprice, $26.50 per share, beats all the previous bids by a huge margin --of course, Oracle lowballed their earlier offers, and ended up basicallybidding against themselves and the optimism of other Peoplesoftshareholders for a year and a half. It's been a pretty grueling fight(was it worth it? How much of Peoplesoft's most valuable -- human --resources will walk out the door the day their options vest?) made allthe more so by the widely-held assumption that Larry Ellison was eitherbluffing or screwing around.So it's over. I don't have Oracle/Peoplesoft's spat to kick aroundanymore. I'll have to stick with condemning the merger as a totallyunworkable deal between two sides who absolutely hate each other. And Iwon't dwell on the irony of an Oracle employee being driven out ofOracle, starting his own company, and forcing Ellison to spend $10.3billion to get his company -- but not him -- back (though it does ratherdelightfully remind me of Coca-Cola basically giving away the bottlingfranchise and then spending billions to buy it back). Ellison isbrilliant enough to make this merger work, but he's crazy enough towreck even the soundest of deals. We shall see.

===========Input: Casino Stock Isn't Quite Blue-Chip Byrne : Back in the day (2000-2003 or so) some of the hottestnon-homebuilding stocks were the gaming equipment manufacturers , whorode a wave of heavy reinvestment in casinos to produce huge profits.Now, all that reinvestment has paid off, and, along with a good dose ofconsolidation, made the industry moderately hot again.Like every boom, whether merited or not, the big companies have bigmoves in the early stage, but it doesn't get attention or turn into amania until we see a frenetic IPO or two. You know where this is going:Las Vegas Sands kicked off its first trading day with a 60% gain after alast-minute increase in offering price to $29 a share, outside the$24-$26 range bandied about after they dropped their first $20-$22estimate. But, well, the business is complicated and the business istough.Wynn Resorts , another owner of the lucrative Macau license thatcaptured investors's attention during the IPO, illustrates this wellenough: Steve Wynn, the company's founder, made a gigantic fortune whenhe bet his company's future on Atlantic City. When investors saw his$160 million all-debt investment turn into a $440 million asset in justa few years -- his net worth took a similar, though even lessgravitationally-bound arc, rising from $2 million to $75 million durignthe same time) they all rushed in. Needless to say, Wynn sold wheneveryone else bought, and he made it through the cannibalizingnear-collapse those casinos faced in the early 90's.So, applause and cheers all around to the casinos raising suchspectacular sums for your broad-scoped ambitions. And a prematureapology to the newly-minted shareholders, who will doubtless see someeye-popping returns in the right direction for a little while and thenface a long road back to the reality that is a price around half thecurrent one.Full disclosure, just for the hell of it: I was bearish about theGoogle IPO, too. Thank God I didn't sell short

Well, sort of.It turns out the anonymous company, BaikalFinansGroup, shares an addresswith OOO Tverneftemash, which was recently bought by ZAOGazpromgeocomservice, not to ever be confused by the similarly-namedGazprom (which by the way has a similar logo). Gazprom, of course, isthe gigantic, Kremlin-supported gas company most observers assumed wouldbid for the assets. There aren't many groups in Russia who can afford a$9.3 billion bet, particularly when it's such a politically-weightedone. Gazprom may have arranged some last-minute debt financing, or mighthave an outside partner, but I seriously doubt they weren't in some wayinvolved with the company that won the auction.The logos:

In other words,a competitor has decided that one segment of the company's business ispotentially worth $42.5 million. Investors have prudently valued theremaining business -- the extremely well-known Everlast brand, thepossible new reality TV show, and most of the company's assets -- at anegative $16.5 million.

A glance at the analyst opinions shows thatthey have a lone bull cheerleading the stock, and plenty of bearshammering it.That's evidence enough that it's underpriced; the market usuallyreacts to a downgrade by dropping the stock a percent or two, but Ican't help it -- I presume most of these downgrades arose from theclassic "Well, what does your analyst think?" "He says it's a buy,""Well, what's it done this year?" conversation. Nobody wants to becaught recommending a loser, and unlike portfolio managers with a NetAsset Value report card every trading day, analysts can essentiallystart fresh with each new opinion. The best analysts get noted, lauded,and showered with cash. The worst? Well, they're still averaged in withthe rest.And anyway, I don't consider analysts anything but aggregators ofpublically-available information and echo-chambers forpreviously-determined opinions. They can't really add much withoutstraying into the realm of inside information, and what they do add isusually factored in the moment the report is released. Or, in an idealworld, it should be. Thankfully, ours is a less-than-ideal, though by nomeans dystopic, market, so we get plenty of opportunities to profit fromthe mistakes of others. As long as the bearish opinions of analystsweighs down on Krispy Kreme , I'll be a bull.

Watching a stock drop after hours, open lower, and close even lowerthan that makes me wonder just who's selling: a runup usually builds ona gradual crescendo of greater-fool theory -- everyone thinks they canalways sell to someone dumber -- and ends when the greatest fool yetgets sick of the whole thing and bails. muckdog : Well, it's owned heavily by everyone.

If that's an accurate number,investors should cheer up: Merck's at fifteen times annualized earnings,twelve times forward earnings, and underappreciated by most of WallStreet.Full Disclosure: I own Merck. I bought the day of the Vioxxannouncement. And if I want to stay that contrarian, I'll have to sellonly when I get an inside tip that they've cured cancer, AIDS, heartdisease, and death. J. Nathan : If you read the quarterly more carefully, you'll notice that thecharge is not related to liabilities from Vioxx but merely costsassociated with legal defense, i.e., just the cost of paying the lawyersin all of these cases. If thats how much they're willing to pay forlegal defense, imagine how much the actual liabilities are gonna be.Good blog, I found you via your instalanche. Byrne : Thanks for your compliments. Usually, I don't read the filings ascarefully as I should -- I leave it up to alert readers, I guess.Anyway, I still think the Vioxx risk is overestimated -- if the tobaccoindustry can sell something with no health benefits for years, get sued,and 1) Keep the product on the shelves, 2) Remain in business, and 3) do2) to the tune of several billion dollars per year in profits, weMerckers might be safe.

===========Input: China: We could always ignore them, right? Byrne : One of the rules of thumb that has guided my (limited) businesscareer from the beginning is that China is never as lucrative as itlooks. This assumption is based on about 150 years of economic history,including several booms in interest and investment in China. Theirbiggest problem: There's usually a 200-to-1 ratio of Nearly StarvingPeasant Laborers to Absurdly Well-Off Government Employees. And now it'san iffier 100-to-1, since there are also rich private sector employeesand the labor force isn't quite so expendable. What they've been missingfor years was the real driver behind any consumer economy: Consumers.Specifically, they didn't have a real middle class. That's changed inthe last twenty years, as increasing social mobility and a burst inforeign demand has finally made China a genuine, rather thantheoretical, contender. And they've even supplied proof of theireconomic viability, announcing that they've beaten Japan for exports tothe US .If only I'd figured this out in early 2002, when their stock marketwas by some stretch of the imagination cheap. Tanger : I dunno if you want anything to do with their stock market. For one,its perforance last year was pretty dismal. More importantly, its astructural nuthouse. Unfortunately, minority shareholder rights arevirtually non-existent, and excluding the dodgy financial statementslisted on the exchange, lots of times companies are more interested ingenerating cash from an IPO then actually bothering with shareholdervalue.

Byrne : Georgia's Insurance Commissioner, John Oxendine, claims that Marsh'got off the hook' -- and you can bet he's got a plan to fix that.Perhaps the worst feature of Spitzer's Attila the Hun-like sweep throughthe financial services industry is his habit of breeding imitators, whowill essentially use his settlement as a benchmark for creating theirown demands. Interestingly enough, this morning's Wall Street Journalreported that Marsh paid a higher fee than they needed to -- that the$850 million number was agreed upon at the last minute mainly so Marshcould pay out over a four-year period without admitting guilt. Therhetoric we're hearing -- that Marsh may have cost customers billions ofdollars -- doesn't match the reality that in a few cases, theymanipulated bids, but that the proven damages thus far involve only afew million dollars of business priced 5% or 10% higher than itotherwise would have been. Crazy.Full Disclosure: I own shares of Marsh, and I would not beparticularly dissapointed if Eliot Spitzer's career took a suddennosedive thanks to, say, questions about his business relationship tomoney manager and alleged stock manipulator Jim Cramer.

No idea where this will end up: It's not altogether rarethat these announcements result in a very expensive project to developsomething that, for whatever reason, isn't worthwhile to consumers. Butit's important to remember that the status quo is never more than asnapshot -- investing as though it's permanent is a recipe for disaster.

===========Input: The "Twin Deficits" Myth Byrne : According to the usually reliable CNN/Money, the "Twin Deficits" willcontinue to grow . Interesting terminology... I believe they'rereferring to the budget deficit and... the capital surplus? Whenanalyzing trade deficits, it's important to realize that the amount bywhich imports exceed exports is also equal to the net amount foreigninvestors have bet on the US. So the trade deficit is due to aconfluence of the pressures from US consumers (who control about 20% ofglobal GDP) and everybody else (excluding the non-consumption share ofUS GDP, that would amount to around 75% of global GDP). Which of thoseis -- probably -- going to be a more important number?Even if we are consumers bent on gorging ourselves with importedgoods, the largest pressure on the deficit is that we're simply a betterplace for investment -- higher returns on capital in developingcountries are more than mitigated by the higher political risks theyface. And what about that other deficit? It, of course, is the ominoussum that we fund without taxes, but by borrowing funds. And about halfof those borrowings end up with the major banks in Asia. So, not to be aheretic, but 1) We're issuing them at relatively low interest rates, 2)Inflation is bound to pick up eventually, and so 3) Wouldn't you ratherhave our deficits made up by economically nonsensical purchases bynon-US investors, rather than raising taxes in America? It's a questionof who will pay for the same spending, and all else being equal I'd behappy for Asian central banks to pick up the tab. The Twin Deficits area reality, but they aren't exactly a terrifying one.

===========Input: NYSE Selling Out? Thank God! Byrne : The market didn't have an intelligent way to react to this news(except to send NASDAQ , which I've been cheerleading for a while, up10.46% in sympathy), but the New York Stock Exchange may actuallyconvert to a for-profit entity. It's far too clubby now, and while thismove wouldn't get rid of nine-figure paydays, it might ensure that theyonly happen when well-deserved. Not to name names or anything. Theexchange needs this: it's ossified, the real owners -- holders ofexchange seats -- have seen their investment lose 40% in a year (thoughthey can still earn an income from it to offset the losses), and theNASDAQ has undercut their traditional dominance among growthcompanies-turned-blue chips. Heck, they're down to just over half oftheir single-letter symbols ! It's a dying organization, and this willbe just the jolt it needs for another couple decades of somnambulantstaggering before being ultimately replaced by far more efficientcompanies.Full Disclosure: "Far more efficient companies," basically means "TheNASDAQ," so take it with a gigantic grain of salt.Secondary Disclosure: You can take the above at face value; I don'town stock in a salt company. muckdog : Everything comes with lots of grains of salt. Ever read the label ona soup can? It's amazing they can squeeze any liquid in there. And ifyou crumble up crackers in there, that's even more salt.Well, I'm not sure how I take the NYSE news. I think I agree with youon the wreckless compensation thing. I also think that Sears-Kmartshould come up with a new name altogether. Those stores are deadzones,and they need some buzz. Change the names, paint the buildings,reorganize a little, and hire strippers for cashiers. I'm not sure howthat last idea got in there. Must be friday.

Turns out my initial attitude wasn't justified, of course, andGmail has been a popular success. Just this weekend, Google gave manyusers another fifty invitations , prompting some to speculate that itcould be the start of Gmail's final move out of beta. Their marketingwas absolutely brilliant: Simply through association with Google, andbecause of the invitation-only membership, they created a product withinstant cachet -- something so in demand invitations went for $50 oneBay, and one enterprising site even offered a kidney for an invite. Andnow? Everyone who wants a Gmail account has one, and yet people withinvites have an almost pathological desire to give them away. It's beennearly a year, the service is nearly ubiquitous, and somehow Google haskept us obsessed with Gmail.Want an invite? I've got a dozen.

But when anoutsider buys into the business once it's established itself asimportant, but before it's really gotten profitable, it's big news.

Today, Ask Jeeves madetheir official announcement about acquiring Bloglines. And tonight,Cisco reported solid earnings and weak sales . The market's modestlypessimistic reaction to the Bloglines news tells us that blogging isn'tseen as a major profit source yet; tomorrow's trading will tell uswhether the market is ready to accept that more established technologybusinesses are back on track as well. After hours, Cisco's been slammed,but once they're exposed to the rest of the trading population, theresults might differ. Michael : I don't think bloglines will ever be a major source of profits orrevenues. Blogging itself could become a pretty big consumer past timelike watching TV, reading a book, or playing video games but I am notsure how bloglines really benefits. I would guess it most benefits thesearch engines, hit counters, and software builders.With the explosion in available market commentary that happenedthrough the internet it is not clear to me that by lowering the costs ofaccess blogging really adds that much as much as it did to politicalcommentary.

After all, my biggest surgein hits came from a link from, well, a political blog. However, I'drather not worry -- instead, I'd like to think of our situation as akinto Instapundit , or Andrew Sullivan , or Daily Kos in, say, the summerof 2001. Blogs didn't get huge until people saw them updatedcontinuously on September 11th, and during the primaries, and later onduring the conventions. In politics, there's a definite four-year cycle,and any new medium can find its voice and carve out an audience in thattime. Financial markets aren't so kind.In short, we need a crash, and we need to blog it. jult52 : Your time will come. Byrne : That sounds downright sinister . ira-cam : Those poliblog hits come at a cost. My half-hearted trolling draggedback some hate to my site. No wonder why they turn off the comments. Byrne : I can understand that. When you're blogging about stocks, it'spossible -- though a little difficult -- to say "Okay, you're right, I'mwrong. So I'm going to sell what I had, and sell it short!" And everyonecan be reasonably happy. But a political blog is usually built around acertain ideology, and no matter how compelling you are, you probablywon't change anyone's stated opinions (Instant Counterpoint: CheckLittle Green Footballs now, and compare that to the September 11tharchive).

Byrne : Mel Karmazin is pushing to add Sirius Satellite services to iPods --an interesting idea, inasmuch as it seems to defeat the purpose of both.The iPod's the tiniest possible container for vast music libraries, andSirius is a way to get at lots of content when said music library isunavailable. On the other hand, Karmazin and Jobs are two of thesmartest dealmakers around, so they might find a way to structure thisor spin it to the benefit of everyone.

Plus, a satellite receiver burns a lot of power,even if it could be made tiny. Byrne : On the other hand, the guy has convinced some very smart people tospend huge sums on stupid ideas -- there isn't much talk about it now,but back when his reputation wasn't so hot (late '80s), lots ofjournalists talked about the "Steve Jobs Reality Distortion Field." Hecould get people to ignore every single technical obstacle to an idea,and invest on the basis of something beautifully, but ridiculously,simple.

He once showed up at an investmentseminar dressed as Moses, wearing a crown and carrying tablets.Granville made extravagant claims for his forecasting ability.

With Greenspan's unspoken position as economic czar, that's whatwe have right now: a benevolent dictatorship of the Fed. But one of thewhy dictatorships are so inferior to democracies is that democracyoffers a stable, peaceful transfer of power. Will we have that at theFed, when Greenspan leavesIndeed. muckdog : Can't remember where I saw this, maybe at socialsecuritychoice.org.Anyways, the battle lines for social security privatization are beingidentified as those who are for Choice and Ownership (Bush), versusthose who equate investing in the SP500 as playing the slot machines(AARP, most Democrats, etc).The battle is now for the endorsement of Sir Alan Greenspan. Wherewill Dr. Greenshades come down in this debate? What will he say onprivatization and the associated costs with implementing such a system?I think that'll have a pretty big impact on what happens next... Byrne : Ooohhh...

But theymight have been using Northshore as an alternative source of capital:Having invested all they could risk, it would only make sense to turn toother sources.

Buteven after that huge mistake -- or rather, because of it -- thecompany's top executives began dumping shares like mad . What's scary isthat since they started selling, the stock's down about 5%. Clearly,they were expecting lots more damage. These insider sales were certainlystupid, and probably criminal (though the legal proof may be hard tocome by) but the solution is easy enough: They need to buy stock fromthe company itself, at some premium to the prices at which they sold --they'll have the same stake as before, the shareholders would havegotten their money back (since the premium goes to the company, which isowned by the shareholders), and there's no need to disrupt theirbusiness by taking the matter to court.Or, if you want to do things the SEC's way, you could 1) Hire a bunchof lawyers with the company's (shareholders') money, 2) Hire a legion ofPR firms to explain away that frivolous spending, 3) Hire a newaccountant to magically turn that spending into an investmentamortizable over twenty years, and 4) Settle out-of-court by having theexecs give the SEC some pittance (for which they'll likely becompensated by the company) and a statement that "We neither admit nordeny that we did what you claim, but we'll never do it again." Thank Godfor the SEC -- they've practically made it a shareholder's utopia ,here.

Byrne : Good plan; cigarettes impose pretty high penalties on states,inasmuch as the states are caretakers for plenty of people who are illthanks to cigarettes. What's notable in this debate, however, is thataccording to MSN Moneycentral , tobacco executives are attacking the taxby noting that "While North Carolina's excise tax is only 5 cents, thetotal taxes given to North Carolina by smokers adds up to more than 61cents per pack." Okay, okay -- since the tobacco companies pay lots ofmoney to the states, that's technically accurate. But the point of thesetaxes is to align the price of a pack with the cost to society, andinasmuch as these penalties aren't assessed on a per-pack basis, theydon't -- they're a lump-sum reflection of the taxes these companiesought to have paid before.Interestingly, the policy of making cigarette buyers pay tocompensate society for the costs they impose is a politically palatablesynthesis of the unpalatable notion of simply refusing treatment unlessthey pay full cost. They're basically buying future medical carethroughout their lives, rather than eventually making the (healthy)remainder of the populace pay up. In short: Good plan.

===========Input: Who will lead the revolution? Would you believe MBAs? John A : For my holiday post, I offer a message of hope for the businessworld.In 1994, I was a graduate student in Boston. I was asked to moderatea panel discussion on social entrepreneurship for a conference atHarvard Business School. The conference was being held by a new groupcalled Students for Responsible Business. I expected to see a smallgathering of idealistic, slightly naive MBA students. What I found was apacked room of 200 intelligent, practical,driven idealists. Thesestudents were determined to figure out how to use business as a driverfor positive social change. I left that room with my eyes open to thepossibilities presented by these future business leaders.Fast forward 10 years. Students for Responsible Business is nowcalled Net Impact . In 2004, I had the opportunity to attend theirconference hosted by The University of Texas McCombs Business School.Net Impact had grown to include over 9,000 MBA students and alumni.Approximately 900 people attended the 2004 conference. The buzz wordsflying around the conference included social entrepreneurship,sustainable profitability, working with passion. I met student afterstudent intent on harnessing the forces of business and capitalism toimprove the world. These students understand that business is a powerfullever of change in this world.Recently business schools have received their share of criticism forturning out graduates who seem to have lost sight of theirresponsibility for ethical action. I can tell you that I am seeing apowerful groundswell of change coming from within business schools. Itis not coming from the faculty, or the alumni, or the administration.All these groups continue to pay lipservice to topics of socialresponsibility while avoiding any real innovations in the studentexperiences. The change is being demanded by the students. A littlesecret of business schools is that MBA students have an immense amountof sway. Few choose to use it, but if they want they can fundamentallychange their school. Right now students at business schools are askingfor more discussion of these topics in classes, are initiating serviceprojects, forming support group for social entrepreneurs, invitingspeakers to campus to discuss sustainability, social investing,non-profit innovations, etc. Net Impact is often at the center of theseefforts.These are not isolated events...This is a revolution from within. Ihave no doubt that in 10 years we will see the vast positive impact thatthese students are having in the world of business and society at large.In 1776 Adam Smith spoke of enlightened self-interest in The Wealthof Nations . I often feel that we have conveniently forgotten hisemphasis on enlightened which he defined as being committed to being agood citizen and steward of society. I am excited and hopeful that thisnew generation of business leaders will bring this emphasis front andcenter.If you are an MBA student and want a good reference for comparing howMBA programs integrate issues of sustainability and socialresponsibility into the student experience a good place to start is theBeyond Grey Pinstripes report produced by The Aspen Institute .Happy Holidays to everyone!!

John A : Here's an entertaining little morsel from Business Week Online (nobyline given):But on the subject of succession, those two look like role modelscompared with insurance giant American International Group Inc. ( AIG ),whose aging CEO has no plans to retire. Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg, whoturns 80 in May, groomed two sons to be successors, but both have sinceleft AIG.Greenberg Sr. then created an office of the chairman in 2002,which includes co-COOs Martin J. Sullivan and Donald P. Kanak. Both areconsidered possible successors, but the board won't know Greenberg'spreference until his departure, when it opens a sealed letter. Perhapsthis is a good time for a quick refresher.... The CEO works for theboard ...end lesson.I guess it is not as straight forward when your CEO is also chairmanand one of the largest shareholders. It would be tempting to get on myhigh horse right now about the need to separate the positions of CEO andChairman but to be honest with you I don't really believe that. I knowCEO/chair duality is a popular cause for corporate governance. Howeverthere is little empirical evidence to suggest that separating theseroles affects firm performance in either a positive or negative way.Having a combined CEO/Chairman does reduce the ability of the board toact as a check on management and this does mean that you need to be morecritical in your assessment of the trustworthiness of the top managementteam. This downside of having a combined CEO/chair is offset by (1) areduction of coordination and communication costs at the top of theorganization and (2) an increase in the negotiating position of the CEOwhen dealing with suppliers, potential merger partners, etc. #2 could beparticularly useful in a dynamic industry.I do however look more carefully at the top management team of acompany with a CEO/Chair before investing. It is important that you canget a sense of the trustworthiness of the CEO. Is there high turnoveramong senior managers? Is there a record of regulatory problems? If theCEO is new, I also look at the performance of the CEO's previouscompany. I am most concerned if the fortunes of the prior employer tooka sudden turn for the worse after the CEO left.

===========Input: How to find securities class action lawsuits John A : Yesterday's bad day for Krispy Kreme included some speculation thatthe new securities lawsuit filed against the company would be grantedclass action status. If you are interested in getting information aboutsecurities class actions for a company, you should check out theStanford Law School's Securities Class Action Clearinghouse . This sitehas a very easy to use search function and it might be worth the time torun a quick check on companies of interest to you as possibleinvestments.Researchers affiliated with the clearinghouse just released aninteresting report about securities class action trends during 2004. Theresults highlight trends in types of filings (increase in product marketrelated filings), affected sectors (big increase in energy &amp;technology sector), and overall number of filings (fairly steady).Get the full report here or the press release here .

===========Input: Shareholders Benefit from Employer Reputation John A : It is just about time for Fortune magazine to release its 2005 listof 100 Best Companies to Work For . So now is a good time to ask asimple question: Why should we care? Making this list is certainly asource of pride. It can also be helpful if you are looking for a nicenew job. Should anyone else pay attention to this list?Well, thanks for asking because I just happen to have an answer forthat question. It turns out that investors can benefit by payingattention to this list as well. In a study published in the Journal ofBusiness Finance &amp; Accounting (2003, 30:771-798), Greg Filbeck andDianna Preece found that companies on the Fortune list of 100 BestCompanies to Work For outperformed a matched sample of firms alongmultiple measures of return. This study is particularly relevant forinvestors because the authors measured return after the list wasannounced. To often these studies use as a starting point the momentbefore information becomes public. The only way to benefit from suchinformation is by holding the stock before the information becomespublic. This study indicates that the Best Companies to Work Forinformation may still be useful even after the information becomespublic.It might also be useful to look at companies that have consistentlymade the list in the previous few years and make an educated guess abouttheir inclusion on this year's list. Search the news archives and see ifin the past year the company did anything that might have totally pissedoff their employees. Massive layoffs, bitter union battles, stoppedoffering free massages, etc. You might also want to be wary if the CEOor a bunch of other top executives have been replaced. That can oftengenerate a period of uncertainty in a workforce.

===========Input: It's hard to complain about cheap airfares but.. John A : I can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would invest in theairline industry. Please, someone tell me a group companies facing moreserious problems than the legacy airline carriers (Delta, US Airways,Continental, American, Northwestern, United). High fuel costs, insanepension obligations, and a highly paid, specialized workforce. To thislist of woes, we add a whole slew of competitors with much lower coststructures.I admit I've already taken advantage of the lower fares announcedlast week to book a business trip but these next few years are not goingto be pretty for some of these companies. Unfortunately, the pain is notlimited to these companies. Pittsburgh, one of US Airway's hubs, builtup its airport complete with a sprawling retail complex in the terminal.Now US Airways has reduced flights out of Pittsburgh by 28% sinceJanuary of 2004 and is in real danger of folding completely. These shinynew airports are usually financed by long-term bonds that still have topaid off...but not by the airlines.This is an industry looking for a sustainable strategy. Southwest andJetBlue were the only major airlines to earn a profit in 2004 but whoknows what will be happening in another five years. So I will thankfullyaccept the low fares, bemoan the loss of food on flights, and watchthese companies parade in and out of bankruptcy.BusinessWeek Online has some other commentary about the fare cutshere and about US Airway's woes here .

===========Input: Better Late Than Ne...Aww forget it! John A : Remember how you stress every year to get those #%^^$%# tax formsfiled on time? Just imagine how Nortel feels. Early on Tuesday Nortelwill be filing its 2003 financial statements . It also expects torestate 2001 and 2002 earnings. None of this is really new information.So the worst is behind them right? Maybe. Late filing of auditedfinancial statements and earning restatements both factor into myExternal Reporting organizational indicator. As a rule, I am wary ofcompanies that do either of these things until I am confident that theyhave changed their standard business practices. It may take a coupleyears, and several more financial filings (on time of course), before Iam persuaded to take a second look at the company. The bottom line isthat I rely on SEC filings to assess companies and I don't want to haveany doubt about the veracity of the information contained in thesedocuments.In Nortel's defense, they have just gone through the perfect storm inthe telecommunications equipment sector. The whole industry overbuiltand got blindsided by the tech downturn. This could be described as agrowth industry that went on a bender and is now trying to recover fromthe hangover. I've always felt that you learn a lot about someone whenyou see how they try to recover from a hangover (pause for brief collegeflashback). This is a great time to assess organizational effectivenessin the telecommunications equipment industry. Nortel and Lucentattempted to hide the damage (What do you mean? I'm not drunk!) and hopefor an uptick in demand before they would have to come clean. Bothcompanies have been penalized for these actions and have continued torestructure operations, sell assets, and layoff employees. Cisco, on theother hand, was able to take one huge restructuring charge in 2001 andmove forward. Their ability to do this and have it work (so far)indicates a very deep and impressive understanding of theirorganization. Especially when compared to its competitors, Cisco seemsto be back in fighting form due to it's ability to rapidly assess itsorganizational structure and reconfigure to meet the changing market.Not bad for a company with a hangover!

===========Input: Beyond Hippies and Tree Huggers John A : Socially responsible investing. Corporate social responsibility. Justsaying these words seems to elicit some fairly simplistic knee-jerkreactions. The reaction that I find most amusing is the knowing look ofsympathy. You know, the one that says "Poor naive soul. If only youunderstood economics, you would understand the folly of your ways." I donot intend to get into the stakeholder vs stockholder debate here orargue the relative merits of Atlas Shrugged . Those discussions, thoughinteresting, avoid a simpler question. Do measures of corporate socialresponsibility contain valuable added information that help investorspick winning investments?If all that you have read about this topic is an article in BusinessWeek or The Wall Street Journal , you've probably heard the standardanswer-- the evidence is mixed. That is true but not very revealingwouldn't you say? Evidence is mixed mostly because (1) there is littleagreement about how to measure social responsibility and (2) manycurrent measures toss together a heap of information that has nobusiness being lumped together. Social responsibility often includeseverything from treatment of employees to type of product produced.There is not really any reason to believe that selling guns or tobaccohas anything to do with forcing employees to work unpaid overtime. Yetboth get lumped together in the socially responsible investingdiscussion.Once you start to break apart social responsibility into its variouscomponents, you start to see the valuable information. Companies thathave poor employee relations tend to underperform, as do companies thatpollute at a higher rate than their industry peers. On the other hand,companies with numerous NLRB violations don't do worse than their peersand companies that sell your typical "sin" products (tobacco, firearms,gambling) can be excellent investments. Lump all these things togetherand of course you will get mixed results. Taken separately, they providevaluable information about future firm performance.I guess it is time to get beyond the image of the greedy capitalistvs. hippie tree hugger in this discussion. Though that would make agreat Celebrity Death Match episode.Here are abstracts from 16 significant studies about sociallyresponsible investing and an interesting essay on the subject.

===========Input: I'll take a double shot John A : Yesterday was a tough day for the Seattle scene. Amazon ended the daydown 14.6%. Starbucks down 8.2%. I should disclose that I spent a fewyears living in Seattle and I have a soft spot in my heart for allthings Seattle. As far as I could tell, many people in the Northwestspend the mornings drinking lattes and their evenings drinkingmicrobrews. Really not a bad lifestyle.Anyway, back on topic here. Market over reaction? Hard to say. Bothcompanies have pricey stocks and those valuations are based onoptimistic expectations of future growth. Yesterday's news led many toquestion their growth assumptions for these companies. Today I want totalk a bit about Starbucks. I think I have to start by acknowledgingthat the stock is still pricey even after its drop yesterday. However,my organizational indicators analysis reveals a very low level ofbusiness risk . This may partially justify a higher P/E ratio. A coupleweeks ago, I observed that Wal-Mart had offsetting strong and weakorganizational indicators . Starbucks, on the other hand, has uniformlystrong organizational indicators. Starbucks scores as best in itsindustry on six of seven organizational indicators. Not surprising areits strong scores in the employee relations and stakeholder actionsindicators. Its weakest score is in the external reporting indicator. Inthe past, several observers have raised concerns about aggressiveaccounting at Starbucks but my analysis does not indicate any systematiccurrent issues. The weak score is primarily the result of Starbuckscurrent strategy of increasing equity ownership of several foreignsubsidiaries. This is a strategic shift that has short-term costs andadds some uncertainty to the financial statements.Beyond the strong Organizational Indicator analysis, severaladditional factors favor Starbucks ability to continue to grow revenues.1. Starbucks has little debt. Starbucks is not currently financingits growth with debt. Considering its growth, this is amazing. It alsomeans that Starbucks has a large amount of flexibility in how itfinances future growth. The company can assume much more debt withoutnegatively affecting its risk profile because...2. Starbucks has a healthy cashflow and current cash position. Thisallows the company to grow without debt. You could argue that Starbuckshas too much cash and should do more to pass it on to shareholders. Thisoption is another way that Starbucks has retained its flexibility forthe future.3. Starbucks is the primary owner of its stores and limitsfranchising. While Starbucks does partner (airlines, airports, Barnes&amp; Noble), most of its stores are company owned. From a managerialperspective this greatly simplifies cost structures, product changes,and quality control.Taken together all of these factors paint a picture of a company witha very strong future. I cannot say if these factors justify the currentshare price but I would say that they justify a higher P/E ratio thanthe industry norm. Risk is lower.Interesting aside: Starbucks is taking over the location in my townthat was recently abandoned by Krispy Kreme.Disclosure: At the time of this writing I do not own Starbucksstock...but I am tempted and might consider a buy next week. I am alsotempted to go buy a latte after writing this post.

===========Input:  tracy : Got job?And so, I have rejoined the world of the fully employed. AfterChristmas, I got a call from the wife of one of my former bosses (at mylast full-time job). She was looking for a Development Assistant at theretirement community where she works. I started here 4 weeks ago. WM isaffiliated with, but not run or fully supported by, the denominationI've been a part of all my life (UMC). My grandmother (who was Baptist)lived here for a few months before she died in 1995, so I have manyconnections to the job. Our offices are in one of the patio homes, and Ihave my own lovely office with a window. The job's only about 12 milesfrom home, and I'm going against the bulk of the traffic mornings andafternoons. It all seems perfect and yet... Oh, I'm so thankful to besomewhere so nice where I might actually make a difference in people'slives, and I want to keep an open mind and hope it'll last forever, butI have a feeling I'll be restless within a year or so. My boss is a verynice person, but conservative and resistant to technology, i.e.computers, internet, etc. We just got new computers a week and half ago,and she's griping about XP (her old OS was Windows 98--mine was 95, soI'm thrilled with the new stuff). I tell her it'll just take somegetting used to. We'll see.I'm not making the kind of salary I was hoping to get, but it's thebest salary I've gotten thus far. When I was fulltime in radio I made alittle less, but I got quite a few remotes, which make up for notgetting a topnotch salary. I'm still doing my TV announcing and myweekend radio stuff, so that money will help. I'm going to startactively pursuing more voice work in the next month or so, too. My planis to pay off my car early, and then work on the other debts. I thinkit's time to go on and fill out the adoption applications. I'm terrifiedof more debt, but Mom and Dad will help with the money. I'm not surethey realize how expensive it all is. I'm thinking we might lean towardadopting from Guatemala, but we've still not hashed it all out. It'salmost bad making some money now, because while most of me wants to saveas much as possible, the other, smaller part is screaming loudly forstuff, stuff, stuff!!! I've got a trial subscription to XM at workbecause of the Dell computers, and now I'm lusting to have it all of thetime. G got me a nice office stereo for my birthday and it does have anaux jack, so I could listen to it here. He asked if I wanted a carstereo, and I said no, but I do. There are so many things I want. Agarage. A dining room set. New stuff for our house. New clothes. Neweverything. But I want family more. I think part of the draw of theother stuff is I could get it now. But I'd be paying for it later. Moneymakes the world go round and round and round til I'm just dizzy.
